thanks. no problem.
Here it is.
Can't thank you enough. Great report and I wish that I'd been there with you to experience it. I'd like to stay in touch. It's a high priority of mine to come down there (as I've mentioned a few times). I'm going to try and do it before the month's out. I hope we can have lunch or something and compare notes about all this stuff. This won't be going away for quite some time. Thanks again for your help. Best, Jeff Dana Perino <dana@gablegroup.com> 11/14/2000 02:49 PM To: jdasovic@enron.com cc: Subject: Notes from FERC Meeting Hi, Jeff -- I'm so glad you called today and that I could run over to the FERC meeting. Always interesting! Here are my notes -- I apologize in advance if they are a little rough. Over the past few years I've become a much faster typist than when I write longhand. Gov. Gray Davis November 14, 2000 FERC Hearing in San Diego Serious flaws in the energy market in California. Rates are not reasonable nor just. Two points: 1. Given FERC's findings, you must order refunds. If you don't, then what was the point of the findings. Believes FERC has the authority to issue the refunds and called on them to order them sooner than later. 2. Impose hard price caps and big caps that will protest consumers from another anticipated crisis in summer 2001. Davis said he believes that deregulation can work eventually, if market is competitive and all parties act responsibly. But he believes it will take 4-5 years to get to a competitive market. Without the price caps, he believes there will be a lot of unwarranted pain inflicted on the consumers and businesses of CA. He said there is no justification for the huge profits the energy companies netted in the third quarter. He said he won't stand to allow CA companies to be brought to their knees. The market is dysfunctional. People in SD believe the marketplace is being manipulated for obscene profits. Wants to level off dereg for 4-5 years to allow market to work and for more power plants to come online. He said he believes in people making money and that dereg can work -- but only when it's competitive. Strong belief in wholesale price caps. Angry that FERC stripped CA ISO's ability to protect consumers against price spikes. He said FERC's plan is a reckless deregulation experiment and that the Commission's plan will only make things worse next summer. Davis asked FERC to modify its order. He said that FERC doesn't believe that CA can get the plants online. Doesn't blame them given the history of CA, but that he has taken measures to speed up from 1 year to 6 months to site new plants. He's allocated $50 million from the general fund and $500 million for demand reduction, renewables and conservation programs. He believes he can reduce demand and increase supply without public health risks or environmental degradation. He said he wants to have someone accountable/electable to the ISO and the Power Exchange Boards, that the state should have the right to include people from CA on those Boards. He talked about the negative effects the actions in CA will have on other states watching this "great deregulation experiment." He said FERC's proposed solution does nothing to lower prices. To the contrary, it's to bring businesses and consumers to their knees. And Davis predicted "a ratepayers revolt that will strip FERC of its authority and take matters into their own hands." He said he believes strongly that FERC has the remedies to protect consumers, give them rebates and prevent this from happening again. He said if FERC just focuses on getting more plants online, all hell is going to break loose. That FERC can't sit in Washington, 3,000 miles away and take action on CA -- that will only cause more problems. Dana speaking again -- If any of this doesn't make sense or you have additional questions, please let me know. I have a few things scribbled in the margins that may help piece it together better. Again, thanks for the opportunity to help. I look forward to talking to you again soon. Best, Dana Dana Perino dana@gablegroup.com 619-234-1300 ext. 238

Monday was a holiday! Tuesday, however, inevitably came along to spoil all the fun with last minute committee hearing announcements for some significant bills. -- SB 39x (Speier) was heard this week in the Senate Energy Committee. Thi= s measure would define owners or operators of any electric generating facilit= y as a public utility subject to the state=01,s jurisdiction. The bill also places the CPUC in the role of determining scheduled maintenance outages fo= r generation units. Although the bill goes much further, the author=01,s onl= y intention is to give the CPUC a role in coordinating power plant outages, but seems to not understand the implications of doing it in the manner outlined in the bill. IEP opposed the bill and testified to that end along with CMTA, the State Chamber of Commerce, Enron, WSPA, and the California Cogeneration Council. The usual cast of consumer groups supported the bill= . Of particular note during the hearing was the hostility shown to the opposition by the Chair of the Committee, Senator Bowen. The message from the opposition clearly was ignored by the majority of the members as it passed out of the committee on a party-line vote. IEP is currently reassessing its strategy on this particular issue because this is not the only bill that proposes similar changes. -- The Assembly Natural Resources Committee, chaired by Asm. Howard Wayne, was scheduled this week to hear two siting bills. The first was AB 34x (La Suer), which would make various changes to the CEC siting process, includin= g some IEP-sponsored language. IEP has a support if amended position on the bill which has some technical and policy problems, but workable. Last minute amendments offered by Asm. Keeley forced Asm. La Suer to postpone a hearing on the bill until next Monday (2/26). However, because the Keeley amendments basically gut the current language and turn it into a study bill= , La Suer is unlikely to accept them and, according to the negative committee analysis, the committee is unlikely to approve the measure in its current form. AB 36x (Wright), on the other hand, passed the Natural Resources committee with only one =01&no=018 vote. AB 36x would provide expedited siting for a repower project, as defined. However, despite IEP=01,s efforts to get the = bill amended, the current language would help few, if any, repower projects. Th= e author has agreed to continue working with us, the environmental community and the CEC to develop language that works for everyone. IEP=01,s major is= sue at this point is that is should actually work. The measure was double referred to the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee and will b= e heard there next. -- The negotiated language on the QF issue finally has a vehicle, SB 47x (Battin). All stakeholders are not united in their complete support for th= e measure. IEP has may need some additional changes but will be mobilizing members on Monday to educate Senators on the bill and support the measure i= n the Senate Energy Committee when it is scheduled for a hearing. Both SCE and WSPA also have some outstanding issues, but only WSPA so far will be opposing the bill. -- SB 6x (Burton), which would establish and state power and financing authority, passed off the Senate Floor 24 to 14 this week and is headed to the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee next. IEP met with Senator Burton=01,s staff this week to talk about amendments to SB 6x relat= ing to limiting the Authority=01,s eminent domain powers. Staff was open to wh= at we had to say but we have little confidence our recommendations will move forward with the bill. Regardless, IEP will continue to push for amendment= s on the Assembly side. -- SB 33x (Burton), which would require the Governor=01,s plan to purchase = the IOU=01,s transmission to be approved first by the Legislature, is still awaiting consideration on the Senate floor. -- The Governor had another press conference today to provide a status on the negotiations between the state and the three IOUs regarding the purchas= e of the utilities=01, transmission system. Reuters is saying there the Gove= rnor has a deal with SCE to purchase its share of the power grid for $2.76 billion. Negotiations are still going on with PG&E and SDG&E. More information on press conference can be found on the Governor=01,s web site. -- Attached is the most recent legislative tracking report which includes all the special session bills introduced through yesterday. Please let me know if you need copies of any of these bills. UPCOMING EVENTS: MONDAY, February 26th Assembly Natural Resources Committee 1:45 pm, Room 447. AB 34x (La Suer) =01) makes various changes to the siting process. Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee 1:30 pm, Room 4202. AB 38x (Jackson) =01) relates to loan guarantees for renewable energy joint venture agreements. Senate Environmental Quality Committee 1:30 pm, Room 4203. SB 28x (Sher/Battin) =01) makes various changes to the siting process. WEDNESDAY, February 28th Assembly Revenue and Taxation Committee 1:30 pm, Room 126 AB 45x (Kelley) =01) expands the MIC for certain energy production. --end-- Julee Malinowski-Ball Senior Associate Edson + Modisette 916-552-7070 FAX-552-7075 jmball@ns.net - 2001 Tracking Report.doc

Although Houston-based Enron owns no major power plants in California, it has adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high. And it has become, in turn, a whipping boy for California politicians. At one point last spring, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he wanted criminal charges against Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay. "I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' " Lockyer said. With less colorful language, Gov. Gray Davis has often castigated Texas-based companies as price gougers -- even though Texas firms have been fairly minor suppliers to California. Some of it is just buzzword politics. Lockyer and Davis know that Californians dislike anything associated with Texas, and Lay has been one of President Bush's major political supporters. Enron, meanwhile, cites the rhetoric as evidence that Lockyer, Davis and legislative investigators are interested less in finding the truth than in seeking scapegoats. Enron also filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the Senate's subpoenas of trading data. Most other energy companies have complied with the demands, creating Sacramento repositories of the data under elaborate confidentiality agreements worked out with the special Senate committee headed by Sen. Joseph Dunn, D-Santa Ana. But Enron has refused, and on Saturday, Dunn submitted a report asking the Senate for "an appropriate coercive sanction." Does Enron have something to hide? Or does it sincerely believe that what's happening in California is political scapegoating? Are the companies' fears about the confidentiality of the data sought by the Senate justified? Would data be selectively leaked to show the firms in the worst light? Would data be used by competitors? Or could the information find its way into the hands of class-action attorneys? Dunn, a prominent trial attorney himself, insists that confidentiality will be protected and that the information being sought is only for legislative purposes. But Enron and the other companies have some reason to be wary of turning over confidential information to politicians. Similar information was leaked -- without penalty -- in last year's investigation of former state Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. And there are indications that private lawyers are working closely with investigators. Mike Aguirre, the San Diego attorney seeking a "smoking gun" to prove collusion among energy companies, supplied Dunn's committee with a few dissident Duke Energy workers who alleged, in highly publicized hearings, that the firm had manipulated production at its San Diego plant to create artificial shortages and drive up spot market power prices. Duke then refuted the charges by releasing some excerpts from the records of the Independent System Operator, the controller of California's power grid, indicating that ISO had ordered the plant operational changes. Aguirre subsequently asked the governor's office to pressure the ISO -- now under Davis' direct control -- to release all of the Duke-related documents that would show, he says, that the firm actually manipulated the situation. Duke and other companies insist that the ISO-held documents are proprietary. Aguirre pleaded with one Davis adviser in an e-mail that "we need your help in properly getting this information out." But Aguirre, in an interview, said he had not yet obtained cooperation from Davis aides. The political and legal struggle to affix blame for California's energy woes will continue for months, perhaps years. The crisis will cost ratepayers at least $50 billion, and they'll want to know why as they make out their utility bill checks.

Wilson says Davis ignored warnings about energy Former governor defends himself Carla Marinucci, Chronicle Political Writer Friday, July 20, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: Former Gov. Pete Wilson, who signed the controversial 1996 energy deregulation bill into law, blasted his successor Gray Davis yesterday for failing to aggressively use the governor's most forceful tool -- emergency powers -- to contain the state's energy crisis. "There are people who have ignored the supply and tried to blame the crisis on everyone else," the Republican former governor told nearly 100 academics and reporters at the Public Policy Institute in San Francisco yesterday. Arguing that Davis ignored early warnings about brewing problems and "put in jeopardy parks, schools and other capital needs," Wilson said the Democratic governor has skillfully engaged in finger-pointing and public relations to blur perception of the current energy troubles. "They've sought to blame me, and have done so with some success. . . . And they've found a much more profitable and exciting target, President Bush," said Wilson, who wryly pronounced Bush's recent trip to California as "a triumph -- for Davis." But Davis' strategy, he said, "doesn't create one watt of new power." Wilson's speech -- his toughest public remarks to date on the energy crisis -- came the day the Public Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, released polls showing Californians now believe energy ranks far and away as the state's most pressing problem. Many of those voters blame Wilson, not Davis, for the power shortages and rolling blackouts, the poll shows. The former governor's sharp words were rejected by Davis' senior political adviser, Garry South, who said Wilson is trying to "revise history." "If there is one shred of evidence that Pete Wilson said one thing or raised one red flag about energy supply, let him produce it," South said yesterday. "Pete Wilson accusing Gov. Davis of being responsible (for energy) is like Herbert Hoover blaming FDR for the Depression. We're trying to clean up his mess." The GOP former two-term governor spoke on the issue of California energy as members of the Bush administration fanned out across the nation, including a California trip by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, to push the White House's energy policy. But even the president appeared to point the finger at Wilson for some of California's problems. "They hadn't built a power plant in 12 years" in California, Bush told reporters Wednesday. "And guess what? When you grow your state the way they have . . . it creates problems." Such words chafe Wilson, who produced California Energy Commission figures that, he said, showed that small plants were built during his administration. In fact, he argued, the 1996 deregulation bill encouraged energy producers to seek state approval for new plants. While acknowledging the 1996 bill he signed was "flawed," Wilson said, "I thought the flaws would be addressed." "We knew it was not a perfect free market mechanism," said Wilson, adding that he had strong reservations about the utility rate caps included in the legislation. "(That) was a gamble, but it was one that paid off for while." But, he insisted, the bill -- which critics say kicked off California's energy woes -- had benefits for the state. Wilson said it was believed deregulation would spur private industry to build new plants that would fuel industry and "lots of jobs for Californians." Deregulation was also seen as a means to balance power companies' concerns about a lengthy, "nightmarish" process -- which he said dated to the early 1970s -- to build large power plants. Davis "is now posing in front of those plants" opening because of decisions made before he took office, Wilson noted. "I hope that he's pleased with our handiwork." Wilson, also lambasted Davis for failing to heed 1998 warnings from the California Energy Commission about coming blackouts. And, Wilson said, as the state faced rolling blackouts, job losses, and skyrocketing energy costs, Davis failed to use one of his greatest tools in a crisis: emergency powers. Wilson noted that after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, estimates suggested it would take 2 1/2 years to rebuild downed freeways and overpasses. He used his emergency powers to offer incentives to contractors that rebuilt the bridges within 65 days. South, noting that Davis has used his emergency powers to deal with the energy crisis, said there is no comparison between an earthquake and a full- blown statewide energy crisis.

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A second lawsuit is being filed in San Diego Superior Court Wednesday against Enron alleging the company, and others, overcharged California consumers more than $4 billion for electricity service. On Monday, a similar suit was filed against Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI), Duke Energy North America (DUK), Southern Energy Company (SO), AES Corp., Williams Energy and NRG Energy. Both lawsuits are seeking class action status and may be consolidated into one complaint. The complaints allege unfair trade practices and illegal trust activity. A news conference announcing the details of the lawsuit will be held Wednesday morning in San Diego. Enron does not own or operate major generating units in the state, but is active in trading electricity here and securing long-term fixed rate contracts for large industrial customers. At times, Enron sells power back into the California Power Exchange, the market where power is bought and sold in the state. An Enron representative said he has not yet seen the lawsuit and was unable to comment. The lawsuits claim Enron and the other energy companies withheld power supply last summer, created shortages by selling power out of state and used real-time confidential data about power plant activity to drive up prices. The lawsuits are an attempt to force generators to refund about $4 billion for electricity, the amount consumers were allegedly overcharged. -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; jason.leopold@dowjones.com Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Attached is their analysis. In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the agreements-in principle. (Only executed contracts were released by the state in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their nongas costs only. Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time. These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves. Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year. The stranded cost under these assumptions is approximately $10 billion. The spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract. Note: a negative "mark-to-market" equals a positive stranded cost. As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves. Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released. Alan Comnes

As a follow-up to our call. Here is some additional information regarding QF pricing issues. QFs who voluntarily switched to PX pricing have been getting paid full PX prices (and there seem to be a couple of thousand MWs that have switched. The concern is that the Commission's ultimate decision on PX-based QF prices will force the QFs that have switched to "refund" some of the payments they've received (e.g., under a "PX minus" mechanism). The majority of QFs are happy with the judge's proposed decision pending before the PUC (except those remotely located QFs who will take a big GMM hit). As we discussed, the Commission strongly rejected Edison's emergency motion regarding the gas piece of the QF pricing formula. Recall also that a couple of months ago

No. The decision would have prevented the Commission from implementing the legislation that prohibits direct access, at least during the time that Legislature and the direct access coalition work together to try to come up with a compromise to continue to allow direct access. So all this means is that the prohibition still has not been implemented and there currently is nothing before the commission to implement. Sure would have been nice if the commission had passed it, though. Also, did I tell you that i'm in a meeting all day tomorrow in houston and therefore can't do an update call with edward's? i can, however, do it on monday. best, jeff William Gang@EES 03/07/2001 08:28 PM To: Jeff Dasovich/Na/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: Re: PUC Approves DWR Language in Decision; Removes Language Staying Commission Action on Direct Access Does this mean that the Commission has, de facto, prohibited direct access?

The decision that got voted out included Bilas' DWR-based language stating that the PUC 1) would not second-guess DWR purchases and 2) would pass through DWR costs to customers. However, in a move led by Commissioner Carl Wood, the decision removed the Bilas language on Direct Access. The decision therefore did NOT include the Bilas language staying any Commission action on implementing the Direct Access prohibition. Carl Wood called including Direct Access "the height of arrogance." The decision was voted out 3-2, with the 2 remaining Republicans dissenting. That said, the Commission has no proposal before it implementing the prohibition, and there was no talk at the meeting of implementing the prohibition any time soon. Best, Jeff

And he thinks he may have stumbled onto a critical matter involving substantial volumes of storage gas that sat unused during the critical months of the California energy crisis. What Langdon suspects is that the complainant in the case (RP00-241), the California Public Utilities Commission, may have only itself to blame for some of the pressure that built up in the gas market during the months of the controversial large-volume capacity contract between El Paso Natural Gas Co. and affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy Co. Langdon, a partner in the Washington office of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld LLP, in late July was hired by El Paso President and Chief Executive William Wise to conduct a separate legal analysis of the record in the case (IF, 27 Aug, 1). The idea was "not to second-guess the lawyers litigating the case," but rather to "think dispassionately about the events of last year" and give Wise "an independent view" of the behavior of the El Paso companies before and during the 15-month contract for 1.22 Bcf/day of capacity to California, Langdon explained last week. Wise's decision to hire Langdon was eye-catching on a few levels. In his many years in law practice, Langdon had never been retained to conduct the type of assessment Wise has asked for, Langdon told Inside FERC, acknowledging "this really was a little bit of an unusual request." Also drawing attention in this highly politicized case are Langdon's substantial administration connec-tions. He was a major fundraiser for the Bush presidential campaign and his brother is Jerry Langdon, who as a FERC commissioner in the early 1990s hired Chairman Pat Wood III as an adviser. Is it fair to suggest that Langdon was brought on board by El Paso simply for name recognition and the possibility that he may have some positive, collateral impact on the commission's ultimate decision in this case? That possibility "didn't escape me" at the time, Langdon admitted. "I'll not pretend to be unaware that there are these other connections with Wood and the president," he allowed, adding that "that's something that impacts everything I do. But what can I do? I have to practice law." And, "for the record, I barely know Pat Wood." And how can this be considered an independent, third-party assessment if El Paso is paying for Langdon's services? "I recognize that there are critics and cynics" who would suggest that Langdon is simply a hired gun, "but at the end of the day, . . . I'll have to stand behind" the report. He vowed to "call it the way I see it." His final report to Wise won't be ready for several weeks, but Langdon shared some of his initial thoughts and findings. Langdon has been looking hard at the circumstances surrounding the operation of three Southern California Gas Co. storage facilities - the Montebello and Aliso Canyon fields in Los Angeles County and the La Goleta field in Santa Barbara County. During the period that roughly coincides with the El Paso/El Paso Merchant contract, SoCal Gas had been pressing the CPUC to approve the release of large volumes of storage gas from those fields, said Langdon. The state commission finally granted the requests in June 2001, the month after termination of the contract, he related. Release of working and cushion gas from the Montebello field and cushion gas from the Aliso Canyon and La Goleta fields - an aggregate total of 41 Bcf - would have contributed more than 100,000 Dt/day of deliverability to the California gas market "without adding any intrastate pipeline capacity," said Langdon. Characterizing California as a cul-de-sac on the interstate pipeline network, he stressed that "storage is huge" in moderating the market. When pipeline capacity is constrained, "storage is a way to take care of . . . these problems." And yet, the SoCal Gas applications "clearly languished" at the CPUC. "There may be very good reasons" why the state commission took so long to allow release of the gas, but so far "I don't understand how the CPUC sits on a storage application like that during this time period when it's as significant as it is." For its part, the CPUC has argued during the case that El Paso Merchant caused gas prices at the state border to skyrocket by withholding some of its firm capacity on El Paso and that the pipeline dragged its feet in developing the Line 2000 conversion project (IF, 14 May, 5). "I'm trying not to sound like an advocate in this thing," said Langdon, but "I don't understand the CPUC's position in the case, . . . when right in their own back yard they've got these storage issues." As for the allegations that El Paso and El Paso Merchant rigged the open season that led to award of the contract and subsequently "withheld massive amounts of capacity" from the market, "we've reached the conclusion that we don't see that kind of evidence in what's been presented" so far in the proceeding, said Langdon. His team of lawyers is looking closely at "the maze of engineering issues" that could hold the answer to the capacity withholding issue. Langdon all but dismissed the affiliate-abuse charges as the product of badly outdated regulations colliding with unreasonable expectations about how integrated companies should operate in the evolving energy market. Order 497, the marketing-affiliate rule, was first promulgated in 1986, he noted. In most industries, such conflict-of-interest rules are constantly revised to keep pace. But here, the gas industry has "been turned on its head more than any industry I can think of, and yet these rules are the very same ones" that have been in effect largely unchanged for nearly 15 years. "They absolutely need to be updated, end of sentence, end of paragraph," said Langdon. Despite statements during the hearing by Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. about the strength of the El Paso case, Langdon said he was "not at all concerned about the company not getting a fair shake" at the commission. Much of what Wagner had to say "has been sensationalized to a degree" in the press, he said, adding that "what happens in the press and what happens at FERC are two different things." Langdon admitted that he would be "a little concerned" about Wagner's remarks "if I were litigating the case." The judge has used some "pretty strong language" to suggest that the El Paso companies were out of line. But FERC "historically has been a very record-oriented tribunal," and "in this case, the record looks very sound," he said. - Chris Newkumet

Language is attached. - SB 27xx - mockup.doc Right now, this legislation is awaiting the outcome of negotiations involving SCE and other parties (Jeff Dasovich is our rep). Speaker Hertzberg and Senator Burton both have endorsed these negotiations and promised to support agreements the parties reach. Jeff tells me this morning they are getting close to agreement on core/non-core and direct access issues but there are still major stumbling blocks, mostly surrounding the going forward DWR costs and contracts, and the issuance of bonds to pay for them. The bond guys see direct access as possible undermining the bonds. If or once agreement is reached, the expectation is that enabling legislation would be crafted that would apply California-wide. The general structure in the SCE discussion is this - By Jan 1, '03, 500 kW+ customers decide to go to market or stay with utility for a long (5 yrs+) period. Re-entry from market would be with up to 12 month notice and could require customer to pay spot market price under utility default. 20-500 kw customers would have voluntary direct access. Under 20 kw customers would have green-only voluntary direct access. Recovery for past undercollections is being negotiated, but will likely require large customers (20 kw+) to pay a disproportionate share of the costs. This may be less than definitive, but as usual, the situation is fluid. Marty and Jeremy, are you available for a Wednesday morning call with Jeff Dasovich? Also, just in case you didn't hear, the Commission is scheduled to vote on Thursday the 14th on an order that would suspend direct access under the AB1x. The expectation is that the vote will be delayed. Best information says there are not enough votes to approve direct access suspension.

Dan Walters: As California's malaise deepens, Gray Davis' standing plummets (Published Oct. 7, 2001) A year ago, Gray Davis was riding high -- because Californians were prosperous, confident about their future and thus supportive of the political status quo. Davis' high approval ratings had little to do with his actual performance, or any personal affection among Californians for their cool and distant governor. He was just the fortunate beneficiary of good times and good feelings. Today, a dark cloud has descended on the state. A sharp decline in the economy, particularly high-tech sectors, a stubborn energy crisis and, most recently, the terrorist hijackings and murderous crashes of California-bound airliners have left Californians worried about their personal safety and economic security, and they're looking for someone to blame. Davis' approval ratings began to decline early this year as the energy crisis hit home and it became apparent that he had failed to take the initiative in heading off the worst aspects of the situation. And they have continued to sag, thus presenting the governor with a series of interlocking tests as he begins his campaign for re-election in 13 months. The seriousness of Davis' decline was underscored late last month in a statewide Field Poll indicating that, at the moment, most California voters would prefer former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan to Davis. History indicates that Davis should still be favored to win a second term, but if Riordan does become the Republican candidate, he would have at least an outside chance of unseating Davis. Davis' chief problem is that he will be running for re-election in what will almost certainly be sharply declining economic circumstances, the product of a slowdown already under way and the plummeting consumer confidence in the wake of the terrorist hijackings. State tax revenues are in a nosedive, running a billion dollars under projections in the first three months of the fiscal year, and Davis will be compelled to make multibillion-dollar slashes in state spending that will irritate important constituent groups. How big the state budget hole will become is anyone's guess. There's a distinct tendency for state revenues to plummet far faster and further in an economic downturn than official forecasts, just as they rise faster and higher in a recovery than the bean counters project. Some analysts believe that Davis' problem could rival the $14 billion deficit that predecessor Pete Wilson confronted in 1991. Wilson swallowed hard and agreed to the largest state tax increase in American history. However large the state's fiscal problem may be, it will be much, much larger if the state money Davis spent on power purchases this year cannot be recovered from a proposed bond issue. And the $12.5 billion bond issue is on indefinite hold because the Public Utilities Commission, consumer groups and Pacific Gas and Electric are opposing the administration's demand that past and future power purchases be covered by ratepayers without review. It's apparent now that the long-term contracts the administration signed are much too expensive, which is why Davis' own appointees to the PUC are balking. Davis could try to renegotiate the contracts, but that would be admitting that he and his advisers erred in the first place. Or he could accept the Legislature's proposal, contained in legislation on his desk, that only past power purchases be guaranteed and that future contracts be subjected to the scrutiny that private utilities' purchases must receive. But Davis is insisting that he'll veto the measure. The effect of the current flap over bonds and power contracts, as well as Davis' months-long effort to provide a bailout for financially strapped Southern California Edison, and his lackadaisical performance earlier in the energy game, will undermine the governor's claim for a second term. He comes across as someone who dithered when he should have acted, and signed too-expensive contracts even as the power market was contracting. That, and Californians' increasing apprehension about their future, will make his re-election a much dicier prospect than he had envisioned. _____ The Bee's Dan Walters can be reached at (916) 321-1195 or dwalters@sacbee.com <mailto:dwalters@sacbee.com>.

Dan Walters: Davis vs. Lynch -- or is the feud a charade to shield the governor? When Gov. Gray Davis named political operative Loretta Lynch to the state Public Utilities Commission -- and insisted that she become the PUC's president as well -- it was in keeping with Davis' long-established mode of personally controlling major political levers. All of that occurred, however, before California was plunged into the "energy crisis," an infuriatingly complex amalgam of politics, economics, power supply and distribution, and such uncontrollable factors as the weather. When the first strains were felt 1 1/2 years ago, Davis and Lynch reacted, as one might expect, in tandem and, as later experience proved, poorly. They refused, in effect, to intercede with some steps -- such as long-term, low-price supply contracts and perhaps small rate increases -- that would have prevented the situation from deteriorating into a crisis. Last January, when the financial plight of the privately owned utilities brought the threat of major power blackouts, Davis and Lynch were forced to act. But within a couple of months, the previously inseparable partners began cleaving apart, at least publicly. At Lynch's behest, the PUC enacted a stiff rate increase while Davis claimed that she and the PUC had acted on their own, without his knowledge. It was widely seen at the time as a ploy, one that would bring about a rate boost that every authority knew was necessary, without forcing Davis to publicly change position. Since then, the two have continued to act in seemingly divergent ways. The PUC stepped into the political stalemate over Southern California Edison, for example, working up a secret deal that apparently will protect the utility from bankruptcy without having to win legislative approval. And the PUC has opposed the authority sought by the Davis administration to finance bonds that would pay for past and future state power purchases. Administration officials are publicly critical of Lynch and the PUC and circulate stories that Davis considers her to be an impediment. One version had Davis dumping her as president of the PUC in favor of a friendlier member. And PUC officials insist that Lynch is just acting to preserve the historic independence of the agency, first created nearly a century ago as a bulwark against the out-of-control Southern Pacific railroad. A lengthy article in Monday's Los Angeles Times traced the history of the Davis-Lynch relationship and, in effect, endorsed the conventional wisdom that the two erstwhile political allies had grown apart under the strain of the energy crisis. That may be true, but the intensity with which that interpretation of events is being peddled makes one suspicious that it's just another ploy aimed at protecting the governor's backside from the fallout of his less-than-deft handling of the energy situation. Polls indicate that it's the primary reason why his public approval rating has dropped dramatically this year, thus making his re-election next year less than certain. By doing the deal on Edison -- supposedly without Davis' knowledge -- Lynch saved the governor from a huge embarrassment. He had gone to the mat for the utility but was rebuffed by a Legislature dominated by his own party. He had called a special legislative session on Edison but had been told that he would lose again. Holding up approval of the administration's bond-power contract scheme is often cited as the most powerful evidence of a schism between Davis and Lynch, but she may be doing the governor a big favor in that arena as well. The contracts signed by the administration are much too expensive and, if implemented, will cost ratepayers billions of extra dollars over the next decade. Davis needs to dump them, but if he acts directly, he'll have to admit that he made a mistake. If the PUC continues to hold up the necessary authority, he can use that as a lever to force suppliers into whittling down prices, or even abandoning the contracts altogether -- without having to take responsibility for reneging. Maybe Davis and Lynch are feuding, but it could all just be a charade to fool the public and protect the governor.
Here's an attempt at being frank about the legislation without jeopardizing our relationships or commercial prospects. Overall, we respect the effort, but California failed to get the ball over the goal line: On Siting Intentionally or not, California has designed power plant siting laws that make it excruciatingly difficult to construct power plants in the state. Folks seem to have lost sight of the need to balance growth and environmental quality in California. That's why nothing's been built in the state for a decade and developers are going outside the state to build power plants. Tinkering around the edges won't help; and (with all due respect) the legislation passed yesterday tinkers. Real reform is required if California hopes to build the supply necessary to keep pace with Silicon Valley and a high tech culture and tame the price spikes. If developers continue to have to navigate through a maze of a half a dozen--or more--state and local agencies, California's supply problems will continue, or worsen. California needs real, one-stop shopping and it needs it now. On the retail price cap They don't work (we've already developed all the arguments, so I won't repeat them hear) The press has already reported that the measure the Legislature passed simply puts off the day of reckoning. It's like using your credit card--eventually they're going to knock on your door to collect. Now, families and businesses will have a hard time managing their budgets because they can't gauge the size of the balloon payment they'll face a couple of years down the road. So San Diegans who continue to take service from SDG&E will pay the same amount, but the cap will remove the powerful incentive prices create to use electricity wisely. There's a better answer: Instead of urging consumers not to switch, encourage customers to sign with another retail provider. Clearly, the biggest mistake California made was The press and decision makers should spend more time talking to folks who signed fixed price deals with companies like Enron. But for the press reports, they hardly know there's a crisis.

Based on your note, I faxed my Direct Deposit change to Renee Kelso a week or so ago and wanted to check with her to see that she'd received it and that it was in process, but I can't find her name in email.

SB 43 has NOT been signed yet.
-FYI. This is an internal email of the SVMG. Please keep confidential. I'll be monitoring. Thanks. Best, Jeff As you know, the SVMG Energy Committee plans to discuss variable pricing, specifically Severin Borenstein's proposal, at its next meeting on Monday. A copy of his proposal is attached. As I indicated at last week's meeting, I believe the SVMG should consider endorsing the proposal, with certain conditions, for the following reasons: - It provides the broadest, most transparent incentive to reduce consumption precisely during hours of shortage, thereby reducing the chances of involuntary curtailments (blackouts). - It creates a demand response to high prices, thereby reducing the market power enjoyed by power sellers. This may be one of the only factors contributing to a more reasonable, stable wholesale price environment if there is no federal intervention. - It offers a financial opportunity for those users who are able to reduce their demand overall or shift their demand to off-peak periods. The following is a "strawman" draft of an endorsement by SVMG for discussion Monday. I would point out that the strawman is silent on the question of whether customers who choose to opt out of variable pricing must be interruptible, an issue of concern to some. Also, I hope to have additional input from Barbara Barkovich before Monday's meeting. Thanks. Peter Evans ____________________________ Power prices paid by customers must create the incentive to reduce demand during specific hours of supply shortage (and high prices). This gives the greates possibility of getting through this summer without running up a staggering DWR bill and suffering through frequent blackouts. Getting people to reduce demand in response to higher prices would also reduce the market power of sellers. We therefore endorse the proposal to price power use above historical levels (and rebate for power use reductions below historical levels) at the real-time energy price. Our support for this concept includes the following conditions: 1. Historical consumption levels, which would be served under regulated rates, would be based on last year's use, taking into account the customer's historical load profile. Adjustments would be made for increases/decreases in number of employees or number of square feet per electrical meter to account for changes in business volume. Historical consumption served under regulated rates could be adjusted by a ratio (say 75% to 95%) to build in some expectation of conservation. 2. Participation All customer classes would participate. In the absence of real time load data (i.e. residential customers), monthly consumption deviations from historical levels would be priced at the monthly average spot price. 3. Alternatives for Above-Baseline Use It must be explicitly clear that customers have completely unfettered ability to procure power for their above-historical power requirements on their own if they choose to. This could include self-generation, bilateral forward purchases, or purchasing at the spot price from the DWR. 4. Sunset This approach should automatically terminate at the end of 2001, requiring government or regulatory action to extend it. - RTP proposal 32901.doc

Greetings Senator: I'm informed that Mr. Lay is currently out of the country and that your message has been forwarded to him. In the meantime, I am attaching a document that Ken Lay distributed to business leaders at meetings in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles about 2 weeks ago. It is the document referenced in the Dow Jones wire story and does include the Company's view that a core/noncore market structure is the right answer for California (though the document has not been shared with Speaker Hertzberg). Mr. Lay discussed the core/noncore proposal extensively during his trip to Sacramento several weeks ago when, as you recall, he visited Sacramento and met with a variety of legislators from both sides of the aisle to discuss solutions to California's electricity crisis. But unlike the Speaker's core/noncore proposal that I read about in today's San Francisco Chronicle, Enron's the proposal does not shift all of Edison's past due amounts from small consumers to California businesses. The Company believes that all customers should be responsible for the costs that have been incurred on their behalf. I will be in Sacramento on Monday, June 4th and would like to discuss our proposal with you further if you would find it useful and if your schedule permits. I'm also available to discuss the proposal further by phone if you would like to talk before Monday. If there's anything else I can do, or if you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822. Best, Jeff Dasovich
I just talked to Kip Lipper--works for Byron Sher, but Burton relies on him alot. He's drafting the letter that Burton will send to Loretta re: what to do about DA. I've given Kip the quotes from Angelides re: State's fiscal position will remain STRONG through JULY 2001 irrespective of whether the bonds are issued. Kip was not aware of the quotes and was anxious to get them. I reminded Kip that the only reason anyone's given to suspend DA is the urgent need to issue the bonds, but now, even the Treasurer has admitted that there is no urgency to issue the bonds. I told Kip that the letter to Loretta should say 1) there is no longer any need to suspend DA whatsoever, 2) the PUC should commence ratemaking proceedings immediately to ensure that there is no cost-shifting to small rez and biz customers as a result of DA and 3) the PUC should deliver to the Legislature a study recommending any enhancements, modifications, etc. that should be made to the program to ensure that DA is maintained while ensuring that granny is not harmed. He said he would see what he could do and said that he would likely get back to us. There is a concerted effort underway to get the PUC to reject outright at tomorrow's meeting the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC, and DWR's proposed rev. req. The reason: no urgency anymore. Let's take a little time and get it right. Best, Jeff

FYI. From our folks in Sacramento: AB 1085 is AES' competitive default provider bill. It's not an emergency bill, so it will be dealt with throughout the remainder of the spring and summer. AB 57 is a legislator's suggestions on how long-term contracts should be "regulated." Also no an emergency bill. AB18X is an emergency bill and it would create a core/noncore split in electricity similar to the one that exists in California's gas market.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Edison International's treasurer and chief financial officer, Ted Craver, disputed Tuesday a claim made last week that California's utilities risk "technical insolvency" in 2001. Since May, California's three investor-owned utilities have been spending far more to purchase needed electricity than they are getting paid by customers. As a result, the undercollections in the "transition revenue account" of Edison's regulated utility unit, Southern California Edison, grew by $1.97 billion between May 1 and August 31, the company reported to the Securities Exchange Commission. An article Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, which is published by Dow Jones & Co., said that "if the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed the price these utilities are allowed to bill their customers, as currently seems likely, they could become technically insolvent sometime next year." "The way this term was used insinuated that you take the transition revenue account, and whatever the gross number is equates to the amount of debt that you would have to raise," Craver said in an interview. "That is not at all the way it works. That is not an accurate portrayal." California Gov. Gray Davis acknowledged the concerns Friday, saying, "California consumers have a legitimate need for California's utilities to remain solvent, and the state must be committed toward that end." But Edison's Craver said the situation is not that simple. "That transition revenue account balance says nothing about what we have to fund in the market," Craver said. "Southern California Edison has some 37 balancing and memo accounts set up by the California Public Utilities Commission. What we have to fund is the net amount of all of them, plus whatever else is going on, and the net figure is considerably smaller than the $1.97 billion. It's like picking out one line item on the balance sheet and saying this is all that matters. No accountant does that or looks at it that way." Craver also said that the term "technical insolvency" has no specific meaning to him. A PG&E Corp (PCG) spokesman declined to comment when asked this week if it risks technical insolvency next year. The company is seeking refunds from independent generators that have been selling power to the state's utilities, and for the future it has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider a return to cost-based pricing specific to each generating station in the state. Utility bond analysts, nevertheless, are concerned about California utility debt. "I don't believe the utilities are going to go bankrupt, but they don't have any assurance from the legislature, governor or regulators," Bear Stearns's Ted Olshanski said. "The uncertainty is critical." Bear Stearns has a negative outlook on Edison and PG&E bonds due to the uncertainty on the recovery of these energy costs. This summer's period of undercollections has continued into the fall, with the California's wholesale market for Wednesday power at $135 a megawatt-hour, compared with the $65/MWh that SCE gets from customers. The current best asking price for on-peak power fall all of 2001 in southern California is $85/MWh. When asked how long Edison can continue to fund the difference between its purchase power costs and the revenue it receives from customers, Craver responded: "How long can ratepayers or anyone afford those prices, which don't have anything to do with reality? The market mechanisms don't work." California's utilities are hoping to make significant changes to the market, and some of those changes would require action by the state legislature, which is out of session until December. "I don't know that this is something that waits for the legislature," Craver said. "There are a lot of things that can be done before the legislature meets. We have significant issues before the FERC and the CPUC." Olshanski said he hoped for a political solution. "We're not sure how its going to end," he said. "We expect regulators and legislators to step up and provide for a constructive resolution. In the past, the California legislature has approved measures to make companies whole." -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com
Thank you very much for the tech data. Margaret, is there data out there regarding the California utilities performance (i.e., how many rolling blackouts, etc. v. national average)? Thanks again.
Thanks. I'll get you one more name then. FYI: To use a Kaufman phrase, "I'm a little frosted." I'm on a litigation call, on which I mentioned the Plan B (which I got only because I searched out Scott Governor yesterday). On the call Sandi said, "Jeff, there's a response from the Governor to the Plan B, which I faxed to Steffes yesterday." I want you to know that I took a deep breath, and asked Sandi to fax it to the San Francisco office. Unreal....

RICH CONNELL and ROBERT J. LOPEZ and DOUG SMITHS TIMES STAFF WRITER July 10 2001 SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse grou= p=20 of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who h= as=20 aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of= =20 power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private=20 entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid t= o=20 Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the= =20 Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California. Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per= =20 megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas= &=20 Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Powe= r,=20 the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour=20 charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292= =20 an hour by the DWP. In fact, some of the biggest private power companies=20 singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc.,= =20 Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid= =20 for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 pe= r=20 megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents. The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased= =20 by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more= =20 than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencie= s. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest= =20 barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have=20 reaped the highest profits over the longest period. "You have to look at the whole picture," Maviglio said. "The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the=20 generators who wear cowboy hats," he said. "Their profits were 100% to 400%= =20 above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are chargi= ng=20 us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting=20 ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte." The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times o= n=20 the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's=20 electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first=20 quarter. The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in th= e=20 first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's= =20 energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited= =20 to a few generators. Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the=20 reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year= .=20 "All the prices were high," he said, noting the downward trend in costs sin= ce=20 his agency began buying power in mid-January. The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 = in=20 January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour t= o=20 $271, the reports show. In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded= =20 those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, o= ne=20 of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per=20 megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, = a=20 total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a=20 megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average=20 charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the "vilification of= =20 Enron was based on politics, not facts." Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not b= e=20 reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past,= =20 the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered=20 last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric,= =20 said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to se= e=20 the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reach= ed=20 Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing= =20 the power needed by the state were extremely high. More Power Bought Than Projected Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts,= =20 coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas= =20 prices, have begun to tame the state's market. Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May,=20 about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply proble= ms=20 in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of stat= e=20 projections in June and early July. The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June= =20 and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well und= er=20 $100 a megawatt-hour.

Firm says it's complying. CARL INGRAM TIMES STAFF WRITER July 10 2001 SACRAMENTO -- The chairman of a Senate committee probing suspected price=20 gouging during the California energy crisis charged Monday that Duke Energy= =20 is refusing to allow him to make public information key to his investigatio= n. Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Duke has made the price bidding informatio= n=20 from its Chula Vista plant available to committee members and staffers. But= =20 under a federal confidentiality rule, the data cannot be made public withou= t=20 Duke's consent. The documents concern the Chula Vista plant, which former employees have=20 alleged was ramped up and down to drive up power prices during three days i= n=20 January. However, state records show that the agency overseeing the=20 electricity grid ordered those gyrations to keep the power flowing througho= ut=20 the state. Dunn said Duke's refusal thwarts the committee's investigation a= nd=20 efforts to enact possible remedial legislation because the confidential=20 information cannot be shared with others in the Legislature or the public. Dunn said Duke cited a rule of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission tha= t=20 gives the company the authority to decide which records it makes public and= =20 which stay secret. "The only one who can release the data is Duke. We agreed to be bound by wh= at=20 is provided in the FERC tariff, nothing more or less," he said. Former Employees Tell of Maneuvers Dunn noted that the committee is considering trying to obtain the informati= on=20 elsewhere and "release it over Duke's objections." Three former workers at the Duke plant near Chula Vista testified last mont= h=20 under oath that the plant, among other things, was ramped up and down in wh= at=20 seemed to be an effort to maximize revenue during the Jan. 16-18 emergency. But Duke countered immediately that it had merely obeyed orders of the=20 California Independent System Operator, which keeps the state's electricity= =20 grid in balance. Duke later provided Cal-ISO documents backing up its=20 explanation. Duke executives insisted that the former employees failed to provide a full= =20 picture of the plant's operation during the three days. But Dunn, chairman of the select Senate committee on alleged price gouging,= =20 said Monday that by refusing to authorize release of all the subpoenaed dat= a,=20 Duke was guilty of the same tactics. "Duke is trying to draw the impression that it has [provided] the full=20 picture. But they are fully aware that we cannot draw any final conclusions= =20 until all that data has been released. That hasn't occurred," Dunn said. To make a determination whether the Chula Vista power was withheld to drive= =20 up prices, Dunn said, the committee must publicly examine "the bids Duke=20 submitted from which the ISO issued orders to the plant." They include the= =20 expensive hour-ahead and day-ahead markets, he said. Duke, a North Carolina-based wholesaler that operates several plants in=20 California, noted that it considers the information proprietary and=20 off-limits to legislators not on the committee. Duke spokesman Tom Williams insisted that the generator is attempting to=20 comply with the committee's demands. But he was unable to say whether Duke= =20 would agree to make the bidding documents public along with other records t= he=20 committee plans to turn over. "We are complying now," Williams said. "There is some suggestion that we ar= e=20 leaving stuff out when we have not had a chance to testify. . . . I don't= =20 know what we are ultimately going to do." The committee had threatened to cite eight wholesale generators unless they= =20 provide pricing and bidding documents by Wednesday. Six, including Duke, ha= ve=20 said they would comply to avoid a contempt citation. Two, Enron and Mirant,= =20 were cited. Dunn said the committee on Wednesday likely will give companies that are=20 trying to comply an extra week to do so, but others probably will be formal= ly=20 charged with contempt in a report to the full Senate. The upper house is th= e=20 final arbiter of such issues. Although there is scant precedent for levying penalties against those cited= =20 for contempt, Dunn said he favors imposing severe fines.

DAN MORAIN TIMES STAFF WRITER July 9 2001 SACRAMENTO -- Even as the summer progresses without blackouts, and Gov. Gra= y=20 Davis prepares for yet another news conference today to symbolically switch= =20 on a new power plant, the work in the Capitol has shifted to the seemingly= =20 more daunting task of balancing the books. It's a task with potentially far more long-lasting implications for state= =20 coffers, for businesses' bottom lines and for consumers' wallets. In particular, long-term power contracts trumpeted by the governor's office= =20 as helping to bring stability to California's out-of-control electricity=20 market are having the opposite effect politically. A growing concern about= =20 the $43-billion price tag of the contracts is complicating one of Davis' mo= st=20 ambitious energy initiatives: a proposed financial rescue of Southern=20 California Edison, which already faces an uncertain fate in the Legislature= .=20 Questions about the contracts come as California readies a complex=20 $13.4-billion bond sale to reimburse the state's general fund for other pow= er=20 purchases. Critics worry that costs embedded in the contracts, on top of the billions= =20 needed to pay for the Edison rescue, could lead to additional electricity= =20 rate hikes for consumers. Key lawmakers, consumer advocates and business=20 lobbyists are urging that at least some of the pacts be renegotiated. Citing a recent plunge in wholesale energy costs, these critics say the sta= te=20 should work to shorten the duration of the contracts and lower some of the= =20 prices. They argue that the state entered into the deals under duress after= =20 California's utilities neared insolvency and the state Department of Water= =20 Resources took over the purchasing of electricity for more than 25 million= =20 residents. "They are vulnerable," Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen=20 (D-Marina del Rey) said of deals the state struck with independent power=20 companies when prices were at record highs. Bowen lauds Davis administration negotiators for signing "the best deals th= ey=20 could." But she said that in the crisis atmosphere in which the negotiation= s=20 took place, "the state had two cards and the generators had 50." Contracts Open to Challenges The contracts could be challenged in court or, more immediately, before the= =20 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in Washington. There, an administrativ= e=20 law judge could direct that the pacts be reworked as part of a settlement o= f=20 allegations by Davis that generators overcharged the state for electricity = by=20 $8.9 billion. "We ought not to say, 'Fine, the contracts were the best we could do,' "=20 Bowen said. For his part, Davis says he is willing to accept partial payment of the $8.= 9=20 billion in the form of contracts with terms more favorable to the state. He= =20 attributes the recent sharp drop in wholesale electricity prices to=20 conservation, the administration's effort to increase power supply and--a= =20 major factor--the long-term contracts, which slashed the state's reliance o= n=20 the volatile daily, or spot, market. "You can see the value of these long-term contracts . . . dramatically=20 shrinking our overall price, which is what matters to Californians," Davis= =20 said, pointing out that the average cost of power plunged 30% from May to= =20 June. Davis energy advisor S. David Freeman, who helped negotiate the contracts,= =20 said they may end up costing less than $43 billion, given the recent declin= e=20 in prices for natural gas, the main fuel for California's=20 electricity-generating plants. Freeman also compared critics to someone who calls the fire department to= =20 douse a blaze. "After the fire is out," he said, "you complain about the=20 water damage." The contracts have other defenders, among them UC Berkeley economics=20 professor Severin Borenstein, who says the deals helped to tame the volatil= e=20 spot market by reducing generators' incentive to drive up prices, while=20 reducing the state's exposure to wild swings in price. "The point of signing long-term contracts is not to get a great price; it's= =20 to reduce risk," Borenstein said. Still, experts have been picking through the pacts ever since a Superior=20 Court judge in San Diego, ruling in a California Public Records Act lawsuit= =20 by news organizations and Republican lawmakers, ordered last month that Dav= is=20 unseal the contracts. An analysis done for the Assembly by three experts--one each representing= =20 Southern California Edison; the Utility Reform Network, a consumer group; a= nd=20 large electricity consumers--concluded that the about $43-billion price tag= =20 announced by the administration may not account for all the costs. When oth= er=20 expenses are factored in--ranging from environmental equipment upgrades to= =20 any new energy-related taxes--the contracts could cost an additional 10% to= =20 20%. "Once the contracts were made public," Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte = of=20 Rancho Cucamonga said, "just about anyone who can read began calling for=20 those contracts to be renegotiated." As buyers' remorse spreads through the Capitol, the contracts increasingly= =20 are seen as a hurdle--or a bargaining chip--as Davis and lawmakers confront= =20 fast-approaching deadlines in their effort to prevent the energy crisis fro= m=20 morphing into a broader financial crisis. A bill pushed by Davis to avert bankruptcy for the financially hobbled=20 Southern California Edison must be approved by Aug. 15. The deadline could = be=20 tighter, because the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn for a monthlong=20 break July 20. Davis' rescue plan, along with legislative alternatives, languishes in the= =20 Legislature. The plan, which has little apparent support, would require the= =20 state to buy Edison's system of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and=20 permit the utility to charge ratepayers for the rest of its back debt of $3= .5=20 billion. Some lobbyists and lawmakers believe that the electricity rate hike approve= d=20 in March by the California Public Utilities Commission--at 3 cents a=20 kilowatt-hour the largest in state history--may not be enough. The revenue= =20 generated under the new rate structure must cover the costs of the long-ter= m=20 power contracts and repay the planned $13.4 billion in bonds, which would b= e=20 the largest municipal deal ever. Whether there would be sufficient money left to pay for the Edison rescue= =20 remains to be seen. But some experts say the utility may need to seek a=20 separate rate hike to cover its costs. As written, the contracts have few escape clauses; Davis cannot simply walk= =20 away from them if he concludes that prices are too high. Still, criticism= =20 persists and crosses political lines. Harry Snyder, longtime Sacramento lobbyist for Consumers Union, and Jack=20 Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn.,=20 rarely find themselves on the same side of a debate. But in separate=20 interviews, they sounded similar themes. "If there is a way to buy our way out of these contracts, even if we have t= o=20 pay damages, we'd be better off in the long run," Snyder said. Stewart, like other business leaders, does not advocate abrogating the=20 contracts. But like many familiar with the terms, he hopes that some deals= =20 can be renegotiated. "They are problematic," he said. In a move that critics fear could lock in high electricity prices for the= =20 next decade, the Davis administration is pushing the PUC to agree within a= =20 month to limit its authority to question costs incurred by the Department o= f=20 Water Resources as it goes about procuring power. State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the PUC must act so he can complete the= =20 $13.4-billion bond sale. A binding agreement is necessary so that Wall Stre= et=20 investors can be assured that they will be repaid. "The state will be out of cash by the end of the year without the bond sale= ,"=20 he said. "We will move toward fiscal insolvency." The so-called rate agreement, a draft of which was obtained by The Times,= =20 would bind customers of the three big regulated utilities to pay more than= =20 just the principal and interest on the $13.4 billion in bonds. Consumers=20 would have to pay for consultants, lawyers, to pay taxes, fees and other=20 as-yet-undefined charges that may be incurred by the Department of Water=20 Resources. Additionally, the PUC would be obligated to approve payments for programs b= y=20 which the state would pay large and small customers to cut electricity use,= =20 although the Legislature has not approved the programs and their details=20 remain to be worked out. The Department of Water Resources estimates the co= st=20 to be $800 million, spread over this year and next. "It is loaded up," Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco)= =20 said of the proposed rate deal, adding that it would require the commission= =20 to "raise rates to cover whatever the Department of Water Resources decides= =20 to do." "That is giving a blank check to some bureaucratic office," he said. 'Dictatorial Power' Warning Stewart of the manufacturers group also is alarmed by the plan, saying it= =20 would provide the water agency with "dictatorial power." "As skeptical as we are of the PUC process, at least there is a process,"= =20 Stewart said, referring to the commission's procedures to set electricity= =20 rates. "There is no process for DWR. DWR just tells the PUC, 'This is what = we=20 need,' and the PUC must approve it." Others say the rate agreement is a standard piece of work, given the=20 extraordinary step the Legislature took in January when it authorized the= =20 Department of Water Resources to buy power for utilities that had fallen so= =20 deeply into debt that they could no longer carry out their obligation to=20 consumers. In essence, Davis energy advisor Freeman said, lawmakers in January created= =20 "the equivalent of a public power purchasing agency" beyond the jurisdictio= n=20 of the PUC.

Power Hogs May Get Hit In Pocketbook Davis favors tiered rate increases David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer Sunday, March 25, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: N30195.DTL Gov. Gray Davis, faced with the near inevitability of raising consumers' electricity bills, is leaning toward a rate system whereby those who use more power pay more than those who conserve, The Chronicle has learned. Sources close to the governor said he is being lobbied by his own staff members to accept a so-called structured rate system. Top officials from his own administration told lawmakers Friday that the state may end up spending more than twice the $10 billion previously estimated to purchase power on behalf of California's near-bankrupt utilities. If so, the officials warned that consumers' electricity rates could double. In the case of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., this would mean customers' average monthly power bills would rise from $60 to $120. Consumers throughout the Bay Area believe that at least some increase is on the way. "We're going to have to bite the bullet and pay the money," said Larry Webster, a retired Caltrans worker in Redwood City. "We might as well admit that electricity is no longer a nickel. It's a dime. If you're going to use it, let's pay for it." Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, distanced himself yesterday from estimates that rates would double. The figures reported in the press, he said, "were wildly high." "The governor still believes he can live within the existing rate structure, " Maviglio said. "Until we know the results of the negotiations with the utilities, you can't conclude anything." The state is negotiating a multibillion-dollar bailout package with PG&E and Southern California Edison Co. to relieve the utilities of about $13 billion in debt. PG&E and Edison have been saying for months that there is no way California can overcome its current energy woes without higher rates. The irony of the Davis administration now saying the same thing was not lost on the two companies. "The state is in the exact same position the utilities were in last fall," said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman. "Either wholesale prices need to come down or retail prices need to go up. The disparity is too large." Statewide blackouts last week drove home the precariousness of California's energy situation to ratepayers -- and may have served as a blessing in disguise for the governor. COST VS. OUTAGES If given a choice between further outages and paying higher rates, many consumers said they would accept increases in their power bills. "I don't like either choice," said Janet Leroux, facing the possibility of a gooey mess if the air conditioning goes out at her downtown San Francisco candy store. "But I guess I'd go with higher rates. I sure didn't like the blackouts." Publicly, the governor has been insisting for weeks that rates will stay within "the existing rate structure" -- a stealthy way of saying that January's 9 percent increase and an expected 10 percent increase next year will remain in place. But privately, he and his staff are discussing additional rate increases that could be spread over as long as 10 years, sources said. Utility executives and power generators told The Chronicle last week that a minimum 30 percent rate increase lasting up to a decade is in the cards. "For the good of California, it's inevitable," said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo Park energy industry association. Sacramento resident John Hax observed that when temperatures soar in the Central Valley this summer, he'd be more than willing to pay a higher price for power if this keeps the air conditioners on. "It's like gasoline," he said. "I don't like paying higher prices for gasoline, but that's the price of doing business." Ratepayers draw the line, though, at any increase topping 10 or 20 percent. "If it was 20 percent, I'd probably do it," said Tracy resident Mark Dougherty. "But if it was more, like 50 percent, I'd rather go with rolling blackouts." "I'd rather have blackouts," agreed Jenny Soghomonian, owner of a shoe- repair shop in San Francisco's Financial District. "I don't want to pay rates that are so much higher." NOT EVERY COST PALATABLE This is the tightrope that state officials and industry players now find themselves walking: While consumers may be willing to pay more to avoid blackouts, they aren't willing to swallow virtually any cost thrown their way. Yet if rates are not high enough, they may not prevent daily blackout threats this summer and beyond. "Higher rates are the price signal that it takes for conservation," said Tom Higgins, senior vice president of Edison International, parent company of Southern California Edison. Simply put, he meant that most consumers will not aggressively conserve power, and thus alleviate shortages, unless there is a financial incentive to do so. Rebates proposed by the governor have met with only a lukewarm response, requiring, critics say, too much effort on the part of individual ratepayers. But a sudden spike in monthly power bills almost certainly would prompt widespread conservation measures. "It adjusts consumer behavior," Higgins said. "People want to get their bills back down." RATES' EFFECT ON USAGE He and other industry sources said higher rates are perhaps the only way Californians will achieve the 10 percent conservation goal sought by the governor -- a move seen as vital if blackouts are to be avoided this summer. "It's intellectually dishonest to think there's any other way out of this," Higgins said. Consumer activists' initial reaction to any talk of a rate increase comes across loud and clear: No, no, no. "No bailout. No rate increases. No secret deals," said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. "We need to get back to a regulated system." Rosenfield is the biggest fly in the governor's ointment. He has threatened to push through a ballot initiative re-regulating California's power market if Davis cannot find a consumer-friendly way out of the current fix. Because of Rosenfield's past success in writing a ballot measure on insurance rebates, which delivered about $800 million to consumers, his threat is taken seriously in Sacramento. "We've paid too much already," Rosenfield said. "A fair price is what we were promised by deregulation, which was a 20 percent rate decrease." However, when he was asked whether there was any room to discuss a structured rate increase such as the idea being promoted by the governor's staff, Rosenfield toned down his characteristic rhetoric. "Big users should pay more," he said after a moment's reflection. "I'm open to a tiered system but only if it's fair." Rosenfield quickly added that he would have to see how other consumer advocates felt about the matter before agreeing to negotiate such things with Davis. MOVE TOWARD STRUCTURED RATES Clearly, though, momentum is building toward a system of structured power rates, which probably would include increases of varying sizes for consumers. The California Public Utilities Commission is scheduled to address January's 9 percent rate increase on Tuesday. That increase originally was given only a three-month duration, but most observers expect it to be renewed for at least another three months, if not longer. PUC President Loretta Lynch declined to comment on the likelihood of rates going up but added her voice to those backing a structured system. "I am a fan of restructuring rates to exempt conservation," she said. "People who use a whole lot of power should pay more." The biggest electricity customer in the state is the state itself, now that California is purchasing power on behalf of its cash-poor utilities. The state already has spent about $4 billion buying electricity and has yet to determine how the cash will be recouped from consumers. San Francisco resident Rosita Magee accepts that for California to find its energy footing once more, rates will probably be heading up. "That way, you have more convenience and electricity, more stability," she said. But Magee has come up with another solution, one that doesn't involve rate increases and rolling blackouts. She's moving to Texas. Chronicle staff writers Matthew Stannard and Pia Sarkar contributed to this report. / E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com. ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle ?

We need to respond to him. The NUMBER ONE problem we have in California that is delaying our proposed power plant developments is securing ERCs. My discussions with Calpine indicate that ERCs are their biggest problem as well. (And in case someone hasn't noticed, the two most active developers in CAlifornia are Enron and Calpine.) Air quality laws are definitely slowing us down, and slowing others down, which keeps the new, cleaner plants from being developed. As I have mentioned before, this is actually making air quality worse in that the older, dirtier plants are running more. Further, if you do the math, we will probably never make up for the dirty air that is created by keeping the dirty plants in business because of grandfathering, while the clean plants don't get done because of ever more rigorous BACT standards and lack of ERCs. Having said that, I do not agree that we should send a message that we want to relax or suspend the standards. (However, getting 2ppm plants on line, which will put out of business the 100+ppm plants - as Calpine indicated to me happened in Texas - makes the point that maybe a relaxation or suspension is the environmentally appropriate thing to do.) All in all, though, I believe that sucha common sense approach will go nowhere in California because the little people in the regulatory positions as well as the public will make sure that we pay for such a message. Having said that, I will repeat the key things that we should be promoting, in my opinion: 1.) stop the EPA from tightening the BACT standards to ever increasing levels of insanity. (GE will not guarantee the present, and new, EPA requirement of 2ppm, which EPA "determined" with no new operating data. They just did it because they could.) 2.) Stop making up rules for RACT adjustments. (Kelly Brodbeck is working very hard, for example, to develop a program in the Bay Area to retrofit boats with clean burning engines to create ERCs. A high level staff guy at BAAQMD "believes" that we should be RACT adjusted, probably making the program uneconomic. There isn't even unanimity for this position on his staff. However, this position if it sticks is irresponsible in light of the fact that the boats can just keep on doing what they are doing. We are creating ERCs, which the BAAQMD will take a portion of in their haircut, and in using the ERCs, we will eventually put out of business the dirtier plants. So, our program gets RACT adjusted and the air gets dirtier...) 3.) Allow for payment of mitigation fees in lieu of buying ERCs. There is precedent for that, but this has to be run through the SIP and the EPA. Again, the in-lieu fees can be used for gov sponsored ERC developments (e.g., electric lawn mowers, electric water heaters, etc.), which will clean the air. I am aware that Sandy is working with the CA legislature on this. Go Sandy!

California regulators told congressional lawmakers on Thursday that clean air regulations are not to blame for the state's electricity shortages and said new legislation seeking to ease air quality rules was unneeded. Speaking at a House Commerce Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee hearing, the head of the California Air Resources Board repeatedly said environmental regulations should not be suspended for the sake of electricity. "Air quality laws are not interfering with California's ability to bring new generation on line and run existing power plants at maximum capacity," said Michael Kenny, executive officer of the board. When asked by Democratic lawmakers on the panel about a provision in a pending electricity bill, the California regulator said the state did not ask for a relaxation of clean air rules and did not need the change. "We believe that air quality-related sections of the legislation are unnecessary," Kenny said. Rep. Joe Barton, the Texas Republican who chairs the energy subcommittee, said the measures allow flexibility to states for the temporary suspension of environmental laws. He said the key point of his bill is to ensure the lights stay on in California this summer. The Golden State expects to face threats of blackouts starting this month, when air conditioning use accelerates. Objections raised by Kenny to the Barton bill included disagreement on a section allowing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to waive, when asked by a state, the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act pertaining to nitrogen oxide emissions. Kenny said the state already gives flexibility on the issue and contended the legislation would go too far and be problematic. "The waiver applies to all new generation facilities in the state and does not allow for consideration on a case-by-case (generating plant by generating plant) basis, where unique local factors can be weighed," said Kenny.

September 26, 2001 By KIMBERLY KINDY The Orange County Register SACRAMENTOA state Senate committee is set today to start serving 16 subpoenas on electricity producers and officials who manage California's energy grid to determine whether they acted in concert to manipulate energy prices. The investigative committee, headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol: "the palace coup." Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis, pushed the state into the power-buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers. The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter, the president of the Independent System Operator, acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge. Winter defied his own board and Gov. Gray Davis when he filed a 50-page request to remove the caps, records and interviews show. "I don't know how these events could have taken place without some concerted effort," said Dunn. The subpoenas will force those involved, including Winter, to provide sworn testimony about the events to the committee, and to turn over e-mails, personal calendars and memos. Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor felt "betrayed" by the actions of Winter. "The governor believes it was the defining moment, when what was a mounting problem turned into an instant crisis," Maviglio said. Winter refused comment, referring all questions to the public relations office. ISO spokesman Gregg Fishman said Dunn's committee will find no criminal conduct. The decision was made by ISO upper management with one goal in mind: to keep the lights on. At the time, generators were refusing to sell power in California because of the price caps. "It was an emergency," Fishman said. "We had to take action.'' What became known as the palace coup began on Oct. 26 when ISO board members voted for severe restrictions on the amount of money electricity producers could charge for power. The restrictions would drive prices as low as $65 per megawatt - nearly 12 times below the $750 per megawatt limits of seven months earlier. "They (electricity generators) grinned and beared the $750 price cap, but this new plan by ISO was too much," said Dunn, whose committee has been investigating since March. "All hell broke loose.'' Records show that on Oct. 31, power generators and electricity traders filed letters with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, demanding that the new plan be killed. The letters, six in all, were sent within two hours of each other and represented dozens of power generators. "If not removed immediately, the (ISO) price cap will sow confusion in the market, threaten reliability and stifle new investment in generating capacity,'' read one letter written by Duke Energy Vice President William Hall III. Although there is nothing illegal about the generators acting together to lobby against price caps, Dunn believes the letters and other actions around the same time showed clear coordination among energy officials. He said the main aim of the subpoenas will be to determine whether collusion occurred to "fix" prices, which would violate federal trade laws. In the Oct. 31 letters, electricity producers told federal officials that if price caps weren't removed it would lead to a collapse of the energy market. The generators got their way. The next day, the federal commission killed the new pricing plan. What was left in place was a $250 price cap established five months earlier. Power producers then turned their attention toward killing that cap, saying they couldn't make a profit even under these constraints. They began to withhold power from California, and on Dec. 7 the ISO declared its first Stage 3 emergency and braced for blackouts, which were narrowly averted. What followed the next day is considered by the governor and Dunn to be the pivotal moment of the energy crisis. Winter, who in his position as president and chief operating officer of the ISO, submitted a 50-page emergency request, asking federal officials to abolish the $250 price cap. Final authority over lifting the cap rested with the federal government. Neither the ISO board, which had established the price cap, nor the governor learned of Winter's actions until the cap had been removed. In fact, the attorney who helped draft the emergency request, Charles Robinson, was in a meeting with representatives of the governor and ISO board members just hours before the filing was made. He didn't mention anything about it. "In retrospect, we should have told them,'' Robinson said. With the price caps gone, the generators filed paperwork with federal regulators justifying higher costs. "The ISO staff sat in a meeting with the governor's key energy advisers with poker faces, not saying a word about something that was going on at the exact same moment,'' Maviglio said. "It was beyond belief that they failed to mention something so significant. This action accelerated the utilities' move toward bankruptcy and forced the governor to move the state into the power-buying business." Prices for electricity jumped from an average of $249 a megawatt to $700 a megawatt within three days, ISO records show. Dunn believes the resulting overcharges for electricity exceeded $30 billion. Robinson said the filing - granted two hours after the request - helped rather than hurt Californians. Prices, he said, did not spike as a result. Instead they followed the skyrocketing price of natural gas - which is used to run power plants to generate electricity. Robinson said the emergency order allowed the ISO to secure refunds should overcharges for electricity be proven to federal officials. "We believe the action we took addressed a severe concern,'' Robinson said. "In our view, we did not believe we changed or made worse the financial situation. We felt we made it better because it introduced a process for review and refund." Jan Smutney-Jones, who was the ISO board chairman at the time and executive director of a group that represents power generators, said Winter did not consult him about eliminating the price cap. Smutney-Jones also said he was unaware of anyone in the power-generating community being consulted. "Terry did this by himself,'' said Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers. "He did what he thought had to be done at the time to keep the power flowing." The ISO board called an emergency meeting the next week demanding Winter explain his actions. Some board members pushed to have Winter removed, but there were concerns such action would lead to more chaos, the governor's spokesman Maviglio said. James J. Hoecker, the former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chairman, defended making the December decision and also defended Winter. "They filed an emergency motion, and we were not about to let California go dark,'' Hoecker said. "They (ISO management) did what any independent system operator would do." What Dunn's committee hopes to learn is why all these events transpired. He believes memos and e-mails around the time of Winter's Dec. 8 actions should provide vital clues. "We don't know why he did what he did, but we are eager to find out," Dunn said. "Terry said he made that filing in the interest of Californians, but I find that argument has no basis in fact.''

Key Barriers to Distributed Generation Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took= a=20 step in the right direction. Utility stand-by charges have always been=20 designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20 monopoly prices from customers, or both. But there is no reason to limit t= he=20 elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20 1MW. These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for= =20 California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc= e=20 the risk of black outs this summer. We would propose lifting the cap by=20 offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o= f=20 distributed generation. =20 Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20 investor-owned and municipal utilities Solution: The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is = a=20 step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20 interconnection studies within 7 days. California should ensure that this= =20 requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20 generation. In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when= =20 interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome= =20 through executive orders or other regulations. To the greatest extent=20 possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th= e=20 utility and place that control with the California ISO. This could be=20 accomplished through amendments to SB 27X. Permitting and Air Quality Issues Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs= or=20 greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an= d=20 therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20 generation faces. =20 Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru= =20 D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant= =20 output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil= ities.=20 In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to= =20 face local opposition. The State should ensure that local, parochial=20 interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects= . =20 These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X. 3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase= =20 Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20 Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with= =20 suppliers. Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th= e=20 goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible. However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk= =20 concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms. We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c= redit=20 risk concerns. Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and= =20 is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to= =20 both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements= =20 going forward. Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20 charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power. From our= =20 analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20 California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California. = As=20 such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat= es=20 adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases. Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018 The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public= =20 Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are= =20 =01&imprudent.=018 On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref= use to=20 allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20 purchases. Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr= ee=20 to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that= =20 DWR has entered into with suppliers. =20 Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to= =20 Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority= =20 noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to= =20 the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl= oy to=20 permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i= s=20 extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu= re=20 DWR recovers its power purchase costs. Moreover, as currently drafted, it = is=20 difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in= =20 rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase= =20 costs. Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since= =20 suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover= =20 from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power. Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20 We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri= sk=20 issues. We have identified three options: Amend AB1X The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the= =20 PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur= red by=20 DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary = to=20 ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases. This is the= =20 preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political= =20 challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X. (See attached file=20 entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.) Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20 through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20 implement. However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo= re=20 time to implement than the "legislative" fix. We have attached electronic= =20 copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC= =20 would need to issue under this option. (See attached file entitled,=20 Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac= cept=20 other forms of credit from DWR. Those options include a letter of credit,= =20 cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral. DWR officials have= =20 indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR= =20 prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through= =20 contract amendments. 4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001 Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20 Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports= =20 showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance. They diffe= r=20 only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available. Al= l=20 credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer= =20 of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20 likely. =20 CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20 summer by approximately 5,000 MW. These numbers are in line with our=20 estimates. California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,= well=20 below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio= n=20 in the West. Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power= =20 than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20 unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t= o=20 date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t= he=20 flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20 California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to = this=20 requirement. =20 Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early= =20 draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve= re=20 supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced= =20 number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20 utilities. Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren= t=20 pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be= =20 added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest. CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of= =20 rolling black outs this summer. The CEC paints a considerably more=20 optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000= =20 MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand. It is our view that California= =20 should view the CEC's "rosy scenario" with considerable skepticism. 5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California= =01,s=20 Electricity Crisis This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution. We wil= l=20 deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing= =20 bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals. As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20 crisis must focus on four issues: Increase supply Decrease demand Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher) To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. = =20 Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less= =20 than a year. In California, it takes about six years, or longer. The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi= slation=20 are steps in the right direction. Our suggested amendments can improve tho= se=20 efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face= =20 in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20 requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements. Enron=01,s= =20 proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20 transfering credits between air districts. In addition, it creates an=20 innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20 emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a= ir=20 districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20 required reductions in pollution emissions. Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle: AB31X (Wright) Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing= =20 the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the= =20 best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer. This can be accomplished mo= st=20 effectively and quickly in two ways: Buy-down demand California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun= d=20 to finance DWR=01,s power purchases. California could likely reduce demand= more=20 economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou= ld=20 be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,= =20 through the summer months). DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20 determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions. To=20 participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20 necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20 reductions. Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D= eal=20 Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort. Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements: An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price= =20 for hour-ahead power in real time.=20 Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment= =20 verification.

We further estimate= =20 that the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time= s=20 that amount. We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20 directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20 control systems that would support load curtailment implementation. Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi= cle:=20 SB27X The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we= re=20 customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy= =20 service providers. Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from= =20 customers and businesses. It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th= e=20 prohibition against Direct Access. Enron's legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a= =20 direct access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o= f=20 Water Resources' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from= =20 customer migration. =20 In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when= =20 the utility is removed completely from the procurement function. Procureme= nt=20 is not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20 condition in which the utilities now find themselves. California should=20 therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20 function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20 non-utility provider within 36 months. To execute the transition, Californ= ia=20 should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period = in=20 which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments= =20 of utility load. Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative = vehicle:=20 AB18X Utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand= . =20 In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20 imbalance. In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers= =20 and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ= ia=20 State government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend= ed=20 period of time. Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc= e=20 in California's energy markets and the private sector's willingness to=20 participate in that market. California can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a= =20 series of staged rate increases.

As we discussed, Enron plans to change the structure of Enron Telecommunications, Inc. from a regular C corporation to an LLC. As we discussed previously, this change in structure will require the approval of the California Public Utilities Commission, because it is a change of control under the definitions of the Public Utilities Code. You indicated that someone inside Enron was concerned that, during the course of the CPUC=01,s review of the request for transfer of control, the CPUC could get access to the books and tax returns of ETI=01,s parent EBS or other Enron entities, which Enron would find unattractive. You asked me to discuss whether this was possible. At a general level, the CPUC in the past has asserted jurisdiction over entities affiliated with entities regulated by the CPUC. Depending on the facts at hand, a variety of provisions in the PU Code grant this jurisdiction. However, the CPUC rarely uses its jurisdiction to look into the books and tax returns of an affiliate of a nondominant telecommunications carrier, unless the affiliate is the entity seeking to acquire control of the carrier. For nondominant telecommunications carriers, the Commission applies a fairly light regulatory touch, because such carriers have no market power. You should also be aware that there are other provisions in the PU Code that protect carrier's financial information from public disclosure. Thus, although it is possible that the Commission would seek to review the books and/or tax returns of EBS or another Enron entity in connection with the change to an LLC, it is unlikely. ETI is a nondominant carrier, and there is no real change in the ownership of ETI, because EBS will still be ETI=01,s owner (i.e., EBS will own an LLC, rather than a C corporation), nor is there any change in the management personnel of ETI. The one wild card is that Enron's name is quite well known to the Commission because of Enron's presence in the energy market. While this logically and legally should make no difference, it could conceivably trigger increased Commission scrutiny of the transfer of control. Please let me know if you need more information or want to discuss further. SPB
see you at the freight. best, jeff
Greetings: I'll be out on vacation all next week, but will be periodically checking voicemail and email. Best, Jeff
Is there any migration risk, i.e., can customers choose in Connecticutt? That will be one of the first questions.
great idea.
Congratulations. Even though it's the EEI agreement, getting Edison to agree to sign something is an achievement. Good luck landing deals.

Unless someone has a different view, I think that we're all on the same page and ready to go. In that regard, you should have received via fax of the language that Sher has put together. I propose the following. Please chime in with suggestions, alternatives, etc. Everyone review the language quickly and provide comments. Simultaneously have Mike Day very quickly draft language (this morning) capturing the ideas we've discussed (to make it happen, I think we need to provide the specific language). I will write a note now to the group that's been negotiating the core/noncore deal, explaining what we think ought to be included and informing them we'll provide legislative language shortly . Assuming that most in the group buy-in to our proposal, we have Hedy/Bev/Scott work with their lobbyists to get it inserted in the language. Thoughts? Best, Jeff James D Steffes 07/03/2001 02:36 PM To: Paul Kaufman/Enron@EnronXGate, Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron cc: Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: CA Bond Legislation Language I think that the goal of Govt Affairs should be to (1) ensure that customers never on utility service post Jan 17 should not pay, and (2) try and find a compromise with the other parties to allow customers who leave by some date certain will only pay for the unrecovered cost on a $/mwh basis. Basically I am arguing that Enron should require DWR to calculate its unpaid balance on some date certain and determine the appropriate surcharge. I know that this is a very long shot. We should make this recommendation as a help to our business teams even if we are going to lose. Do we need a conference call with Lobbyists to work through this on Thursday? Jim ---------------------- Forwarded by James D Steffes/NA/Enron on 07/03/2001 02:30 PM --------------------------- Scott Stoness@EES 07/03/2001 09:33 AM To: Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Don Black, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Draft Bond Legislation Language As discussed, we have two possible approaches: 1) Home Run Strategy: The following change: The commission shall, within 30 days from the date of the application, issue a bond financing order establishing a DWR Bond Charge that shall be applicable to all electric power delivered in California by electric corporations subject to the jurisdiction of the commission, with the exception of electric power delivered by suppliers other than the utility, who contracted for such delivery prior to the effective date of this legislation. We use San Diego large customers as our example of customers who should be exempt from a surcharge because they have been off bundled rates for the duration of the turmoil. Risk is that our customers will not be fully on until about August 15. Thus if the wording gets changed to "who are taking delivery as of the effective date of this legislation" we have failed. Positive is that it removes the CPUC (anti enron) discretion. 2) 1st Base Strategy: The following change: c) The commission shall conduct such proceedings as it deems necessary to inform the public of the revenue requirements and to establish rates to enable the department to recover the revenue requirement. Such rates will be designed i) such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR bond costs that the customer or customer class caused. Risk is that the CPUC will interpret these words unfavorably to us. ie. If we touch the system once we pay the whole surcharge. Scott ---------------------- Forwarded by Scott Stoness/HOU/EES on 07/03/2001 09:14 AM --------------------------- Scott Stoness 07/03/2001 08:40 AM To: Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Don Black, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES, Dennis Benevides/HOU/EES@EES Subject: Draft Bond Legislation Language Harry. I read through the proposed legislation. In summary it: Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission. The commission would approve the adjustments to the DWR Bond Charge as may be necessary to ensure timely recovery.... The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements. The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be padi from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001. Although we could live with this legislation the issues I see are: IBM would not escape a surcharge even though they may not have caused any DWR costs. SImilarly, large San Diego customers, who have not caused any DWR costs, would be subject to a surcharge. I am having a hard time understanding what they intended to achieve with the clause "The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001." Does the 2nd half of this sentence freeze the Jul 31, 2001 rates until the bond is paid off; or Is it just an attempt to define that rates should not go up to pay for the bonds; or [this is the most likely meaning in my mind] Is it just defining that the act comes into effect on July 31, 2001 If it is possible, we should advocate: Regarding, SDG&E, customers who did not contribute to DWR costs: Imposes a DWR Bond surcharge applicable to all electric power delivered in California .... subject to the jurisdiction of the commission. The commission would conduct hearings to establish rates to allow the DWR to recover their revenue requirements. Such rates will be designed i) such that the bond revenue requirements will be recovered, and ii) to reflect the amount of DWR costs that the customer or customer class caused. And we should get a legal interpretation of "The DWR Bond Charge shall take precedence over all other costs and disbursements to be paid from the fund and shall be paid from revenue derived from rate levels in effect on July 31, 2001." To make sure that we are not going to get surprised. Scott
Attached is a draft of taking points I'll use for the conference on Monday. If you'd like to see the agenda, here's the URL: I'm on the "summit's" second panel: "What do we do now?" I've been asked to identify the big problems, propose solutions, and identify the forum for the solution (e.g., CPUC, CA Legislature, FERC). There are two documents. One is a document that I previously distributed and used as talking points for the Cal. Energy Markets conference last week. The other is a table listing the issue, the solution and the forum. I have 5-10 meetings to make opening remarks, then there will be a discussion led by the "facilitator." All comments are appreciated. Best, Jeff

We have committed to Bowen to get her staff a first attempt at draft language by close of business tomorrow. The attachment to this email is a draft which has been discussed by the customers group coalition. We would like to have input on this language by 11 am PST tomorrow if at all possible. Please email responses to Mike Day at mday@gmssr.com or calling 415-279-0702. The aim of the bill is to provide specific direction to the DWR and CPUC so that they cannot use their discretion to make customer choice more difficult. In addition to the language in the draft attachment, several other issues were discussed on the call. Please comment on these as well if you can. 1. In sub para. (c) it was felt we should carefully define the stranded costs DWR might face so they have to show actual damage from a customer leaving. CMA proposed defining these "actual costs" as "the costs that DWR cannot reasonably avoid until one or more of its long term power contracts expire." Thus, if the load electing direct access fits within the DWR short term purchases, there are no stranded costs and no exit fee. 2. Should there a limitation on the number of times a customer can switch into and out of the bundled service portfolio? CMA and other customers were willing to live with a limit of one switch a year. 3. Should customers be required to give DWR notice of their desire to return or the expiration of their direct access deal? There was some willingness to do this, balanced against a desire to not be too specific or to do DWR's work for them. 4. The large customers were very uncomfortable with having the definition between small customers who could switch without restriction and large customers who could not be 500 Kw. That is the number the core/noncore advocates are pushing as a dividing line. The group would prefer that the limit be 100 Kw, which is the limitation adopted in AB 265, the SDG&E rate cap bill from the end of last session. Thus the 100 kW figure has a legislative connection, but still allows a fair number of commercial customers to have unlimited flexibility to switch. This is detailed and prescriptive language, but the customer group parties were strongly convinced that any effort to craft regulations at the CPUC would be much worse, leading to the desire to limit the CPUC's discretion with specific language. At this stage, after hearing that CPUC Comm. Wood hoped to use ABX -1 to end direct access ( a comment made to NEV or Greenmountain), we tend to agree.

I often wish I were on the Portland trading floor in that gov't affairs job but that's history and my family is here in DC where they correctly thought they belonged. I'm writing because I just interviewed to be Pat Wood's technical advisor, one of FERC's top positions, and wanted to alert you that I mentioned you and your group as a reference. I hope that is ok; in my view we parted on good terms. He gave me the impression that I am very much in the running. I don't know if Enron people are applying and don't want to compete with them. But I think I'm generally on the same page with you on policy issues and I expect you would favor having more familiarity with markets and market-oriented policies on staff there. Given your companies longstanding relationship with Wood I thought you might be consulted on this. If so, I am asking for your support. Thanks! Rob Gramlich 301-280-6195 Do You Yahoo!?

We can't set a date til we know if they're available. Borenstein is available Fri Nov 17 but I don't know about Shapiro. If anyone has other matters to discuss we can go ahead with a call at 3 without Lee who is unavailable today.

Playboy Online staff cutbacks Playboy Enterprises plans to cut about a third of the jobs in its online division, according to the Wall Street Journal. As part of a company streamlining, a spokeswoman for the media company said 44 jobs are being eliminated in its online unit. Playboy Online had revenue of $13.1 million in the first six months of the year, and counts 95,000 paying subscribers to its service. "We're not a particularly ad-driven company, but we can look at the financial outlook as well as the next person, and we look at the economy and want to make sure we can weather it well," the spokeswoman told the Journal.

Just talked to Peevey. He told me that he and Freeman personally worked with Bilas on Bilas' draft decision--the decision designed to make CDWR creditworthy and keep the PUC from touching Direct Access until the Legislature has a chance to fix the AB1X prohibition. I made the pitch re: decision does what it takes to fix the creditworthy issue and the Commission needs to vote it out immediately. He said he agreed but expressed his general frustration with the decision making process generally, and said that he is not certain right now if the decision is greased to get voted out at the next Commission meeting. He said that he's going to be talking to the Governor this afternoon and will push the issue with him. I asked him to keep me updated. He said that he would. I told him that it wasn't helpful that the Governor named names in New York regarding alleged agreements about "haircuts," particularly when folks are trying to negotiate deals with DWR. He wasn't aware of that and asked me to fax him the Merril press, which I did. I'll also fax him our letter supporting the Bilas decision. Best, Jeff
5 State Energy Advisors Fired Over Conflicts Ethics: The consultants were involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock they owned, setting up a clash of official duties, personal interests. JEFFREY L. RABIN; DARYL KELLEY; RICH CONNELL TIMES STAFF WRITERS 07/28/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition A-1 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company The Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances. A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, according to state records. All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned. In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled. Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants "may have crossed the line," said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests. Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings. Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state bond sale in U.S. history. The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the $12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines. Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political reform laws. Critics question the distinction. "The governor's approach may be convenient for him," said Jim Knox, executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, "but it ignores the law." Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that "decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest," Knox said. "Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing." The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year. More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according to state records. In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws. It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to state when they bought the energy stocks. One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the governor of "a conscious policy of secrecy" in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records available. "We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks," the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an interview. The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a $500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power and negotiating contracts, records show. A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could not be reached for comment. The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times. All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of California's electricity deregulation. Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California. Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago. He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value each time. Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team Thursday and fired. "I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't give me an answer," Mead said. "[He] just said your services are terminated. "I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and we're the pawns." Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, in her final days working at the electricity exchange. A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power for up to 20 years. In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation. Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb. 28. Purchase of Enron Stock Defended "I don't see a conflict," he said. "At the time, we weren't really dealing with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron." Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job. That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. "We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards," he wrote. "That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters." "Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person." However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects. Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the record. Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. Pact Specifies Financial Advice The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide "financial advisory services" to the state. The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like the other two firms, it too was hired to provide "financial advisory services" to the state. That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power company interests. The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract. PHOTO: Barry Goode, above, governor's legal affairs secretary.; Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Thanks very much Scott. Could you also forward to the SF office. Much appreciated. Best, Jeff
I'm not sure, but I have a sneaking suspicion that all you folks are finished this semester. Just wanted to say congratulations. I'm finished with this semester after today, but have one--that's one--class to take next semester to finish. Also, though I can't make the ski trip this weekend, I definitely plan on skiing a lot this winter (maybe I'll see you at Squaw Deepikah), so let's stay in touch on the ski front. Happy Holidays to all. And if anyone has any questions on creative off-balance sheet financing or or the ins-and-outs of bankruptcy, please feel free to get in touch. Best, Jeff
Works for me.
David: Thanks so much. I'd almost given up hope. I will be distributing the proposal immediately and attempting to garner support industry-wide, across the nation. Can't make any promises of support, but will be working hard to try to bring people together. I'll be in touch soon. Don't hesitate to contact me to discuss it further. 415.782.7822. Best, Jeff

A number of questions/concerns come to mind. I briefly discussed these concerns with Sue Nord late last week, but wanted to put them before the group for possible discussion on our next conference call. When I read the memo from Stamos (Illinois counsel), it appeared to me that the categories of requirements might be able to be divided into "regulatory" responsibilities vs "commercial" requirements. In the regulatory column would be things like the annual designation of an agent and the annual identification of the CEO. Also, the certificate itself needs to be renewed every 2 years (FYI--I don't think I saw that requirement in the chart) Other items such as participation in the One Call Notice System and the tax contributions might fall into the commercial category. These requirements not only need to be kept track of and adherred to, but there is also the consideration of what the resource costs are associated with them for both the IXC certifcations and the CLEC certifications. And are there penalties in place if we don't comply? Scott/Donald/Sue--can we discuss next call?

Davis open to tax on electric generators' profits Updated: April 4, 2001 - 5:52 p.m. Gov. Gray Davis says he is open to supporting a windfall-profits tax being proposed by lawmakers on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to California this year. He also broke with his appointees on the Public Utilities Commission in saying private companies and other large users should be allowed to contract directly for power with generators. . . . . For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their power from generators instead of going through the utilities. A January law that allowed the state to begin buying power for two nearly bankrupt utilities barred such side contracts. "That was done originally with the thought the state would have more power and no one to sell it to if companies got off the grid," Davis said. "But our problem is the opposite this summer. If companies want to get off the grid, we should encourage, not discourage that." The Democratic governor's comments came after he met behind closed doors for more than two hours with Assembly Republicans, who have sharply criticized his handling of the energy crisis. "I think everyone agreed there are no political winners unless we resolve this challenge," Davis said. "There were a lot of suggestions in there I'm willing to adopt." . . . . Davis said he hasn't written the remarks he will make during a five-minute address at 6:05 p.m. Thursday that he has asked California television stations to carry live. However, he said he will "share with them (viewers) the progress that we've made and what we have to get through." He is expected to talk about the more than 40 percent rate increases approved last week by the PUC for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edition Co.

FYI. Hit the wires almost immediately. He handled it with great aplomb and delivered a very good speech. He had the crowd (but for the pie throwin' types) squarely on his side. Best, Jeff Enron CEO gets pie in the face from a protester ? 06/21/2001 Associated Press Newswires Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. ? ? SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A Texas energy executive got more than boos and jeers before starting a speech on California's energy crisis, he got a pie in the face. Jeffrey Skilling, chief executive of Houston-based Enron Corp., was nailed with a pie by a protester at the beginning of his speech at the Commonwealth Club of California. ? Enron has come under fire after accusations from Gov. Gray Davis and state officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices skyward by holding back supply. Enron has denied such claims, and joined other power producers in arguing that the state and utilities owes them billions in unpaid bills. Davis acknowledged that Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which has declared bankruptcy, and Southern California Edison together still owe generators such as Enron, Duke Energy, Mirant and Reliant Energy about $2.5 billion for past electricity sales. State officials countered that wholesalers charged as much as $9 billion in illegal overcharges dating back to May 2000. The feuding groups are to meet in a single room next week under a federal order to try and work out agreements that could determine how billions of dollars will be divided.

We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits. I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is calculated. Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon as possible? Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want to discover there's a charge we don't know about.

We'll poke around.
Thanks, Delaney. See you on Friday. Quick comment: Though just about everything's uncertain these days, folks seem to think that Legislators are likely to get very active just as soon as they arrive in Sacramento (next week?). Seems that a key--if not dominant--part of the agenda ought to be how this group can (quickly) come to agreement on a comprehensive solution that it can offer to the Legislature and the Governor as a pragmatic and positive way out. Sure you folks are very focused on this, but it struck me that the agenda looks pretty ambitious for a 3-hour meeting. In any case, just a thought that I wanted to share. Thanks and can't thank you enough for all your efforts. Best, Jeff

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking into the gas price spikes at the Cal border). The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned power plants). Edison "arranged" for the Brattle Group to be the star witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing. Their job was to set up El Paso and Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day. Their message was simple (and simplistic): El Paso and Dynegy have market power. They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas at the border (to "obscene" levels). That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices. Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets any questions on the topic. It's attached. Apologies, it's quick and dirty, but it provides the basics. Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California Legislature is peddling. Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis when ENA controlled a portion of the capacity), but the overriding goal of the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

(Discussed under separate e-mail). To that end, I suggest the following outline for the strategy: What are our specific business interests in California? Let's be as specific as possible, but limit the list to "hot buttons." In this regard, Jim Steffes identified "the imposition of price caps in the summer of 2001" as the hot button. Are there others? What are the forums we expect will affect our business interests? For each forum, how do we want to posture Enron? Do we want to be the most aggressive company? Do we want to act alone? Do we want to work only in coalitions? What about IEP? What will motivate us to act independently? What is our overall strategy? Do we want to go back to our pre-1999 rhetoric? We can scream louder than anyone else that California didn't do it right.. Peace will be gone ... should we breach Steve K.'s promise to play nice? Do we want to tear down AB 1890 or shore it up? Forum-by-forum identify our: (a) goals; (b) strategy; (c) what we (Enron) want out of the forum. For example, re: the legislature, do we want to identify legislation that we will seek affirmatively? If not, why not?

Greetings and Happy New Year to you both. Eve: Has the sub-group met since things were put on hold a few weeks ago? If so, I'm very interested in hearing about what's going on. If the group is going to meet between now and the 16th, I'm also very interested in participating in those meetings. Delaney, I'll be attending the meeting on the 16th. The Angelides proposal has certainly spiced things up--just what we need, more David Freeman....... Best to you and yours in the New Year.

Greetings: We are getting considerable traction with the idea of using a "benchmark" to judge utility purchases, similar in concept to what's in place on the gas side. To oversimplify it: 1) set the benchmark 2) the utility buys for consumers and tries to beat the benchmark 3) if (at the end of the year) the utility has beat the benchmark, it shares the profits with consumers; if the benchmark wins, the utility shares the losses with consumers 4) the PUC performs no "after-the-fact" reasonableness; no "second-guessing" California likes the idea and is now looking to Enron to come up with what the benchmark ought to be. I talked to Calger a bit about it today and he suggested that I get together with you guys. As always, time's short. Are you available on Monday? Thanks, Jeff

State lowers estimate of energy costs Consumers might see rates decrease Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Saturday, October 20, 2001 ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: Sacramento -- The state lowered its estimate yesterday of how much it will cost to buy power -- suggesting that lower rates could eventually be the result. Officials of the Department of Water Resources said the state will need $17. 2 billion to buy power through the end of 2002 -- about 20 percent less than previously estimated. The agency began buying power on Jan. 17 when the state's three investor- owned utilities were no longer considered credit-worthy. At the time, prices on the spot market reached upwards of $450 a megawatt hour. Now, however, prices average $30 a megawatt hour. "Circumstances have changed," said Ron Nichols of Navigant Consulting, which is a consultant to the Department of Water Resources. "Conservation has helped, we think the DWR contracts have established reliability in the market. We have broken the back of the spot market." Earlier this year, the state signed 56 long-term contracts with various generators to purchase power. Those contracts, which were inked when prices were at their peak, have come under increasing fire from lawmakers and the PUC, and Gov. Gray Davis' administration acknowledged this week it hopes to renegotiate some of the pacts. But the contracts represent only about a third of the power the state needs every day. The rest comes from the spot market -- purchases made just a few minutes or hours ahead of when they are needed. Prices on the spot market have dropped, in part because the price of natural gas has taken a nose dive. It is unclear whether consumers will see any benefit from the lower power costs. If the projections hold, the state could either lower rates or scale back plans to issue $12.5 billion in bonds needed to pay for the energy purchases. At the same time state energy buyers trumpeted lower costs, they blasted the state Public Utilities Commission for a decision that they say could cost residential and small business consumers $8 billion. Administration officials and state Treasurer Phil Angelides said a PUC decision to delay the suspension of direct access -- the ability of large businesses to bypass utilities and contract directly with generators for power -- will shift higher costs to smaller customers. The PUC proposed the ban on direct access in June but didn't adopt the policy until Sept. 20. During that period, the amount of energy large consumers contracted for through direct access increased from 2 percent to 13 percent. "What's happened here is one of the most damaging things that has happened to consumers during the energy crisis," Angelides said yesterday. He urged the PUC to reverse its decision, setting the date back to July 1. But Lorretta Lynch, president of the PUC, said the delay was at the request of the administration and the Legislature. She also objected to Angelides' numbers, saying that the PUC estimates the direct access load at 8 percent. The commission is awaiting a legal opinion about whether it can make its decision retroactive to July 1, and action will be taken at the next PUC meeting, she said.
So far there's Wild Goose, but there in Northern California--have to go through the Wheeler bottleneck--so that likely won't hunt. Lodi's a possibility, but it's well inland, unlike the significantly more strategic storage assets on the coast. In addition, Lodi's in the process of selling, so there's some uncertainty in the short run. Bottom line, folks are trying to build competitive storage, but it's in the "emerging" phase in a very hostile environment. We should discuss further, though; very interesting idea. Best, Jeff James D Steffes 05/22/2001 08:45 AM To: Robert Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: Re: California LNG Robert & Jeff -- Is there some other (competitive) storage that would want to work with our deal in CA other than SocalGas? Maybe find someone adding some new storage. Jim Robert Neustaedter@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 05/16/2001 10:20 AM To: Kurt Jody Crook/Enron@EnronXGate cc: Harry Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: California LNG In response to your request to review the SoCalGas tariff with respect to storage service for quantities of gasified LNG in excess of market I present the following. SoCalGas has various storage rate schedules available to its customers, including forms of interruptible storage service. Because of the long-term nature of the proposed project and firm injection requirements I focused on Schedule No. G-LTS (firm Long-Term Storage Service). Pricing under this schedule is very flexible (both upwards and downwards). I have used the rates included in the tariff which are suppossed to closely correspond to utilty cost of providing such service and are also consistent with rates previously supplied for economic modeling purposes. Keep in mind, these are benchmark costs, and may be subject to downward or upward negotiation. Because of the magnitude of the injection quantities, it was advised that some expansion of storage capabilities may be required. Fixed charges consist of an annual inventory capacity charge, and annual withdrawal capacity charge and a monthly firm injection charge. The monthly firm injection charge is the largest cost component. Based on conversations with SoCalGas, firm injection rights (similar to pipeline capacity) would be sold on a monthly basis. Consequently, in order to have firm rights to injection capacity, it would have to be reserved 365 days out of a year. During the off-peak season, "as-available" injection rights may be used that could substantially lower the cost, but given the inflexibility of unloading of the LNG ships, this was not considered. Variable costs would consist of injection and withdrawal charges in the applicable periods (peak and off-peak) for injection and withdrawal quantities. A fuel retention factor of 2.44% would be applied to injections during the peak period. While not necessarily affecting the overall costs, a transmission charge on injections and withdrawals would also be assessed. A transmission charge on injections would appear as a debit on the invoice, and an equal transmission charge on withdrawals would appear as a credit, effectively resulting in a wash. However, for cash flow purposes it should be considered. The transmission charge is approximately 57 cents per dekatherm. Transportation from storage would require a separate contract. A spreadsheet is attached that quantifies the storage cost on an annual basis utilizing the injection/ withdrawal and inventory assumptions provided. Again, please keep in mind that the actual costs are negotiable. I hope this helps in your analysis, and please feel free to call and discuss further. Robert

Richard: Looks good. One comment: Under the section "Generating Documents: Requests 12, 14 and 18," I would go with the "option 1" ending to the paragraph starting with "For Portland General..." and not the "alternate ending." To further support this ending (and further bolster the point that PGE is pretty extraneous to the investigation), we may want to note that PGE currently has a request in to the OPUC asking for about $135 MM to cover the costs of increased wholesale purchases. Paul Kaufman would have details of the request. Hope your son's doing well.

California Public Utilities Commission 505 Public Utilities Commission San Francisco, California 94102 Re: I.00-08-002 Subpoenas Served on Enron Power Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Inc. ("EES"), Enron Energy Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO) and Portland General Electric Corporation ("Portland General")(collectively sometimes referred to as the "Enron Entities") Harvey, Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities' production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission"). The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by producing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis. We believe that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production, which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of pages of documents. We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future, if necessary. For all of these proposals, we exclude documents that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work product privileges. [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION: Generally speaking, the documents and information that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, within EPMI, EES and Portland General. To the extent that EEMC or EESO are relevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be located within EES. Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions from either EEMC or EESO.] GENERAL DOCUMENTS Requests 1 through 4 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized themselves extensively during the past two years. The burden and expense on Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant. The Enron entities will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational charts, telephone directories and so called "family trees" to show its current organization. To the extent that Enron can readily identify and locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories or so called "family trees" for earlier periods it will also make those available. One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its corporate history. If a list of those books would be helpful, we can provide it. With respect to the other entities, to the extent that corporate histories can be found, they will be produced. We anticipate producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000. Requests 5 and 6 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction Documents will identify its customers and suppliers. FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS Requests 7 through 11 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period requested with respect to financial data. EPMI, EES, and Portland General will provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for the purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data. It is intended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financial information regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to its investigation. We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions. GENERATING DOCUMENTS Requests 12, 14 and 18 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation facilities are limited in number and there will probably be limited documents available. The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation unit requested. The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas Cogeneration. We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of document productions. For Portland General, the production of the requested documents would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000. Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one half of its total energy demand. As a result, we question whether the effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the California wholesale market is necessarily limited. In addition, those transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small California municipal utilities. Thus, the Commission will receive the essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and PX. Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000 electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant. [We propose that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of their energy into the California market. At that time a more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California wholesale market.] [Alternate ending to paragraph: We propose for the voluminous Portland General generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be made available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of facilities. If there are specific documents that the Commission would like copied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producing these documents. We propose to make these documents available in Portland in a third wave of document productions] TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX. EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or a sale. Because of the speed with which you want this information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate. For those transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly. The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading business. EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far more limited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of the Commission investigation. However, EES can also provide similar electronic Transaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specific names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer number. This additional restriction is important to EES because many of EES's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any subpoena and provided an opportunity to object. EES cannot meet your time frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require. Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity of retail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of the wholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retail customers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request. We anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document productions. FERC DOCUMENTS Request 20 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of those responses. We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13, 2000. Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on Friday October 27, 2000. It is possible that not all Enron Entities could make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for production by then. We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order. In addition, if, at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such order. We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know if they are acceptable to the Commission. If you have any questions or comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day or myself.

The utilities request that, on an expedited basis, the Commission limit the scope of the PX Credit audit which WPTF obtained in a negotiated settlement in the 1998 RAP proceeding to remaining year 2000 calculations and thereafter order that the audit be terminated. They state that the audit is both irrelevant and costly and that "common sense demands" the Commission reconsider the decision. They ask that comments in opposition be filed by August 3, reply comments on August 10 and a Commission decision at its meeting scheduled for August 23. They also ask the Commission to waive the period provided in Rule 77.7 for comments and reply comments on a draft decision in order that the decision become final immediately. The filing states that there have been dramatic changes in energy markets, the number of DA customers has declined significantly and that ratepayers should not have to pay for the audit. Of course, they don't mention that the reason for the decline in DA customers is their own failure to pay the PX Credit. It is instead attributed to the "dysfunctional restructuring scheme and concommitant rise in wholesale energy prices." They justify their request legally by stating that their filing demonstrates that there are "significant new facts" and a "material change in conditions." The third criteria for reopening or modifying a Commission decision, a basic misconception of law or fact by the Commission, is not alleged to have occurred. They also state that DA penetration will continue to decline because "Assembly Bills X1-1 and X1-6 have effectively reregulated the market." Attached to the filing are declarations from the three ESP members of the Audit Committee, Bob Anderson of APSES, Aaron Thomas of AES NewEnergy and Marilynn Semro of Seattle City Light Department, in support of the utilities' petition.

Thanks, Mike. I prefer the $15,000/clean slate option. For comments on the proposed decision and lobbying on this specific case, I'm willing to go straight hourly basis, but I will continue to request fixed prices going foward. And worry not, it's not a Rick, Paul, Steffes issue. I'm the headache.

However, between the previous fixed price deal we did on the alternative settlement and this most recent agreement, we have lost $10,000 plus $12,500 for a total of $22,500 on this one case. In both situations, our hours were required by the expanded press of the work in the hearing, and the uncertainty that is involved in estimating the cost of hearing work is always difficult to deal with. As you will no doubt recall, on our last arrangement, I provided an estimate that was much closer to what we have acutally spent on the GRI hearing and briefing to date, which you then proceeded to propose paring on an essentially arbitrary basis. I unable to plead anything other than brain disfunction as to why I agreed with your numbers, which I knew would be too low. So here we are. In response to your proposal, I offer two suggestions, one: we should split the difference between the estimate and the actuals to date. That would mean you would pay $19,761 of the current balance. On that basis, we would prepare written comments and lobby for the proposed decision when it comes out at no additional cost. Two: you pay only the $15,000 that you propose ($13,500 plus the extra $1500), but we clean the slate and start over on the file and any written comments or lobbying on the proposed decision are paid for on a straight hourly basis. I think either solution is fair to both sides. We continue to absorb losses, but get some additional compensation, you pay a bit more, but no more than is fair, and there is still substantial commercial value in the outcome of the case to warrant the regulatory expense. If you want me to explain the situation to Paul or Rick or Steffes in order to assist in justifying the additional expense, I would be more than happy to do so. Thank you, and I mean this sincerely, for considering our request for a revision of the billing arrangements. I am also willing to get together today and talk about this face to face if you want. Mike -----Original Message----- From: Jeff.Dasovich@enron.com Sent: Tuesday, October 10, 2000 9:27 AM To: MDay@GMSSR.com Subject: Bills for Gas Restructuring Activities Mike: We'd talked about getting together to discuss the bills for the case. We'd originally agreed to a flat fee of $13, 500 (if memory serves) with a bonus for coming in under the cap. You've sent me bills (as of August 17 according to my records) for over $25,000. As you recall, we had a very lengthy discussion regarding the magnitude of the work associated with the hearings and associated briefs. I stressed that $13.5 was what I'd spend and that we'd have to do the best we could within that constraint, which is why I pressed for a flat fee arrangement at the outset. With that in mind, I believe that it's important to honor the arrangement. However, in light of the particular circumstances in this case, I'm willing to exceed the previous arrangement for a total of $15,000, but can't go above that. If you'd like to discuss it further, I'd be happy to talk about it. Let me know. Best, Jeff

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--California utility regulators sent a draft audit of Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison's financial condition back to accounting firm KPMG LLP to have "conclusionary statements and value judgments" removed, a person working closely with the state on the issue said Tuesday. "They made some value judgments, but their job was simply to provide an audit," the person said. As a result, the California Public Utilities Commission told the auditors "to go back and take out the value judgments and make their findings neutral," the person said. The final audit, released late Monday, is decidedly different from an executive summary of a draft lawmakers held last week, according to several Democratic lawmakers who said they had seen a copy. For one, last week's executive summary clearly stated that the utilities can recoup billions of dollars from consumers retroactive to August 2000, one Democratic senator said. KPMG and the California Public Utilities Commission declined to comment. The Public Utilities Commission requested independent audits of Southern California Edison and PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. in late December to determine the validity of their claims that soaring wholesale power costs would force them into bankruptcy unless their rates were allowed to rise. The audit of Pacific Gas & Electric, being prepared by Barrington Wellesley Group, had yet to be released late Tuesday. KPMG's final audit shed some light on the severity of Southern California Edison's liquidity crisis and outlined payments the utility has made to its parent company. But it made no recommendations on whether the Public Utilities Commission should grant the utility's request for a rate hike or declare at an end the rate freeze that has kept it from passing its power costs on to customers. The audit says Southern California Edison has paid $4.5 billion more for electricity than it was allowed to charge consumers. It also says the utility has paid $4.8 billion to its parent company since deregulation, with the bulk of that sum being paid out to shareholders via dividends or share buybacks. One adviser to a Democratic assemblyman said it was proper for the Public Utilities Commission to send the audit back to KPMG. "I would have done the same thing," the adviser said. "This is a very charged issue." -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; (END) Dow Jones Newswires 31-01-01 0226GMT

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50% To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market) If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short. Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA) Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts. Potential add-on to deal: Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

State's Power Purchases Costlier Than Projected Tab is $6 million a day over Davis' requests Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau Friday, March 16, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle Sacramento -- California has spent about $6 million more a day buying electrical power than originally projected, according to a confidential document obtained yesterday by The Chronicle. State power buyers spent $2.7 billion between Jan. 17 and March 11, averaging $49 million a day. That amounts to about $6 million a day more than lawmakers figured using Gov. Gray Davis' appropriations requests. The confidential document was prepared by the Department of Water Resources, which purchases power on behalf of the state. It was handed to a group of lawmakers in a subcommittee hearing Wednesday by Water Resources Director Tom Hannigan. To the public, the document presents the first day-by-day look at how much California is spending on power purchases. Although the document shows more money being spent than originally believed, it didn't startle any of the handful of senators and Assembly members who saw it. "I don't think it was a surprise," said Assemblyman Dick Dickerson, R- Redding. Although the state is supposed to recoup the money spent on electricity, analysts and lawmakers say the open spigot on the state's treasury could jeopardize the state budget and fiscal well-being in the short and long term. For example, the state's power spending could jeopardize new education programs and transportation projects. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst warned last month that lawmakers shouldn't count on all the new projects in Davis' proposed budget. Also, California has already been placed on a watch list by several credit rating firms, because of the deep debt that could be incurred in helping the utilities become financially stable. The watch list typically precedes a credit rating drop, which would cause the state's interest on bonds and loans to rise. "This (power purchasing) has a dampening effect," said Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget Project, an independent policy group that tracks state spending. "Nobody knows where the economy is going, and how the energy crisis will affect it, so no one will know what the revenues will look like in the future." The biggest day of power buying happened on Feb. 16 when the state spent nearly $81 million for electricity, or $435 per megawatt hour. The smallest day was March 10 when the state buyers spent $40 million, or $219 per megawatt hour. Michael Worm, an analyst with the investment firm Gerald Klauer Mattison & Co., said what the state paid was in line with current energy prices. "That's where energy prices more or less have been for quite some time," he said. "Of course, they are dramatically higher than they used to be." The governor's office has refused to release information on how much the state has spent, said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. Maviglio said if generators found out how much the state spent the day before, they could force up the price the next day. But Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the public had a right to know how its money way being spent. "People need to know exactly what it is costing to keep the lights on," he said. "We want to know the whole story -- not just pieces." Strickland, along with media organizations including The Chronicle, have filed public records act requests to obtain information on how much the state has spent, along with the details of long-term power contracts signed by Davis. The original bill that authorized the state to purchase power appropriated only $500 million, but allowed the governor to use up to $10 billion if needed for power purchases by notifying lawmakers. The governor's office has sent five letters since Feb. 5 to lawmakers notifying them that additional money was needed. Based on these letters, which in total have requested an additional $2.5 billion, the news media and lawmakers estimated that the state was spending $43 million a day -- $6 million less than the actual costs shown on the Water Resources document. Since the state began purchasing electricity, the health of its budget has become dependent on a variety of things to come, making it as fragile as a house of cards. The money spent on power is taken from the state's general fund and is supposed to be returned through the issuance of state bonds.

Title: Establishment of Four New Balancing Accounts and other Tariff Revisions - Supplemental Filing Purpose: This advice filing establishes four separate balancing accounts: 1) the SCE Utility Retained Generation Balancing Account; 2) the SCE Contracts Balancing Account; 3) the Procurement Costs Balancing Account; and 4) the Ancillary Services Balancing Account. In addition, this filing dedicates a portion of SCE's residually determined generation rate and Commission-approved surcharges between the four balancing accounts based on estimated costs for a twelve-month period and establishes the Generation Rate Trigger Mechanism. Furthermore, in conjunction with the implementation of the four new balancing accounts and the Trigger Mechanism, this filing 1) modifies the Transition Revenue Account; 2) establishes the Net Undercollected Amount Account; (3) eliminates the Transition Cost Balancing Account; 4) eliminates the Generation Memorandum Accounts 2 ; and 5) eliminates the Emergency Procurement Surcharge Balancing Account.

Jesse -----Original Message----- From: Bryson, Jesse Sent: Tuesday, August 28, 2001 3:42 PM To: 'emainzer@home.com' Subject: FW: CA RPS proposal & potential impact Elliot- Take a close look at the language in this bill regarding the RPS. On page 7, lines 29-33, the bill states that all power must be under a direct contract to a retail seller. While this does provide us potential opportunities for scheduling and commodity management as Stacey pointed out, it also prevents merchant plants from qualifying as renewable. This would eliminate our service customers such as Delano, Wheelabrator, and Shasta. The link to the bill itself is: What do you think?

I realize that you are extremely busy, but it would be fabulous if you, or someone else in your immediate department could help us answer this question for the University of Liverpool. Let me know if you think someone will have the time to generate an answer to this question...obviously it is NOT a rush. Regards, Cindy ----- Forwarded by Cindy Derecskey/Corp/Enron on 02/12/2001 09:25 AM ----- Eddie Ping <gg0u8060@liverpool.ac.uk> 02/12/2001 04:47 AM To: public-relations@enron.com cc: Subject: The Californian Energy Crisis Dear Sir/Madam, We are a small group of geography students from the University Of Liverpool, England. We will be visiting Santa Cruz in April on an educational research visit and are focussing our research on the current Californian energy crisis. One aspect that we are considering looking at is effect of the energy crisis on the high-tech industries in and around Santa Cruz. However, the information available at present is limited. Therefore, we would appreciate any help or advise you could give us or pass this e-mail on to somebody else who may be able to assist us. Has the energy crisis reached Santa Cruz or Silicon Valley yet and if so has it/will have any affect on the high-tech industries? Have any measures been taken to mitigate its effects or is it of no concern? We understand that you are very busy but would appreciate any feedback on this subject that you may be able to give us. Thank you for your time and we look forward to hearing from you. Eddie Ping, Martin Price & Ric Mason
This will work for what I need to submit.

Subject: Need for Resources Based upon the discussion in our last meeting, we would suggest the need for increased coverage of the following areas: 1. PG&E's Gas Accord 2. PG&E's attempt to switch backbone jurisdiciton to FERC through the bankruptcy proceeding 3. Movement in Socal's GIR or other plans to open its backbone to firm transport 4. Socal's RLS tariff and requests to reduce the cost allocation to that service. 5. Socal WACOG filings, calculations 6. Tariff changes that provide for backhaul service from SDG&E/North Baja to Socal territory Jeff - this is just a cursory list. Our real need is to have information that comes from a proactive stance in the regulatory processes. Please call Barry or myself if you have any questions. Regards, Stephanie

Printer-friendly version By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators only have the authority to order refunds for about a third of the $9 billion California Gov. Gray Davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May 2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent System Operator. That leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could potentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks. Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC administrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will likely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis expects. Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., "with one goal, and that is to bring back $9 billion." Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO documents show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, for example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October. David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general manager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO. Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from corporate energy suppliers. But during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated by FERC. Davis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators overcharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds. State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation into Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on "shaky calculations." To come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been expected under competitive market conditions. The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at times about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices in the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with air-quality rules. The ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern border, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the fuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity. The ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's "Big Five" power suppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the conclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents. The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest utilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the documents. The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed amounts between May 2000 and February:
on its way. plz review and call. best, jeff
Hertzberg called. We very briefly discussed the scenarios that he asked us to build for him. I've attached the file. the supporting spreadsheets are not included. If folks would like them, let me know. Please keep the file confidential. Hertzberg wanted to see what happened to rates for large (noncore) customers if the small (core) customers' share of past utility debt is shifted to noncore customers. Our analsis shows that noncore rates approach Loretta's recent rate increases when approximately 50% of core's share of utility past debt is shifted to businesess (i.e., to noncore). (In fact, Edison's rate in this scenario is below the Lynch rate, while PG&E's is modestly above.) Increasing the cost shift above the 50% level would start to push rates significantly above the Lynch rates. Note, however, that in its recent submission to the PUC, DWR's asserts that it's revenue requirement is substantially higher than the revenues support by the Lynch rate increase, suggesting that Lynch will have to increase rates again soon. In addition, Loretta's rates also do not reflect past utility costs, which will require yet additional increases. I expect to have another conversation with the Speaker later this evening or tomorrow to discuss the scenarios in more detail (he would still like to put 100% of the IOUs past debts on noncore in exchange for getting a competitive market and out from under Loretta). I will report back after we've spoken. All ideas, suggestions, etc. regarding the attached spreadsheet are welcome and appreciated. Best, Jeff

Three expressed willingness to help. Scott McNealy (Sun): contact person - Piper Cole (piper.cole@sun.com); scott.mcnealy@engeng.sun.com. Mcnealy wants, by close of business today, a "cheat sheet" of the talking points to use with politicians (the "8 or 10 elements of the solution") with the expected comeback he may hear from the political leaders and our response to that comeback. He says he hasn't spent time working on issues in Sacremento so we may also want to include a list of suggested contacts. Kevin Sharer (Amgen): contact person - Sarah Jensen, VP of Engineering and Operations (805.447.6785); ksharer@amgen.com. Sharer wants the same information as McNealy and he and McNealy both indicated their willingness to call a meeting of other California CEOs. Sharer will also be having breakfast with Hertzberg one week from today. Robert Day (Trust Co of the West): said that he is very close to the mayor of Los Angeles. He urged Ken to call the mayor (mentioning Day). Ken would like some talking points for that call. Jeff - please put these items together.

Although we have prevailed (at least for now) on the issue of retroactivity, the decision still violates various provisions of state and federal law. If any party wishes to preserve the right to legally challenge this decision, it must file an application for rehearing within ten days. The attached draft is tentatively dated September 28, meaning that it would be filed next Friday. The primary reasons cited for why rehearing should be granted are as follows: The Decision violates procedural due process guarantees. The failure to hold hearings violates Public Utilities Code section 1708.5(f). The Commission's reliance on material outside the record violates due process. The Decision violates the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. The threatened retroactivity is contrary to law and in excess of the Commission's authority. The Commission acted contrary to law and in excess of its authority. The Decision's purported findings are not supported. The Commission has impermissibly converted a ratemaking proceeding into a quasi-legislative proceeding. Although WPTF members have not had an opportunity to consider whether they wish to support such a filing, WPTF is included as a named party in the attached because of the fact that AReM and WPTF have jointly made numerous other filings in this proceeding. WPTF members will need to determine if they wish to support this effort. I look forward to seeing your comments. Thanks, and have a gtood weekend! Dan Law Offices of Daniel W.

Greetings All: If memory serves, our filing in California is due on Tuesday. Steve Bowen & Co. should be getting me a draft today based on our discussion a couple of weeks ago in Houston. Soon as I get it, I'll be distributing for review. Aim would be to have it in shape COB tomorrow. Thoughts? P.S. Some good news. Recall from our meeting a couple of weeks ago that I mentioned that there were some preliminary filings we had to make in Arizona (in order to transact business there) prior to filing for a CPCN. Well, I've spoken with Robin Hill, and those filings have already been made some time ago, so that's one less thing to worry about. Best, Jeff

The official creditors' committee supports the plan. "This plan is an achievable solution that will enable Pacific Gas and Elect= ric Company to move out of Chapter 11 as a financially strong business posi= tioned to continue safe, reliable and responsive delivery of gas and electr= icity to its customers, pay all valid creditor claims in full, and do so wi= thout asking for a rate increase or a state bailout," said Robert D. Glynn,= Jr., Chairman of Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Chairman, CEO and Pr= esident of PG&E Corporation. "And, the plan will enable us to provide long= -term growth prospects to shareholders." =20 The plan reorganizes Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E Corporation = into two separate, stand-alone companies no longer affiliated with one anot= her. The reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to own = and operate the existing retail electric and natural gas distribution syste= m. The electric generation, electric transmission, and natural gas transmi= ssion operations currently under Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be p= art of PG&E Corporation. The common shares of the reorganized Pacific Gas a= nd Electric will be distributed to PG&E Corporation shareholders. The electric generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operati= ons, when reorganized as new businesses under PG&E Corporation, will have t= he ability to issue debt that will be combined with new financing at Pacifi= c Gas and Electric and used to help pay creditors' claims. The plan also re= structures certain existing debt and uses $3.3 billion in cash on hand to s= atisfy creditor claims.=20 Under the plan, all valid creditor claims will be paid in full, using a com= bination of cash and long-term notes. In total, the plan will provide cred= itors with about $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in notes. The vast m= ajority of creditors-those with allowed claims of $100,000 or less-will rec= eive cash payments for the full amount of their allowed claims on the effec= tive date of the plan. Most secured creditors will also receive 100 percen= t of their allowed claims in cash. Finally, unsecured creditors with allow= ed claims in excess of the $100,000 threshold will be paid 60 percent in ca= sh and 40 percent in notes. =09Following the restructuring, Pacific Gas and Electric Company and PG&E = Corporation will be organized as follows:=20 ?=09Pacific Gas and Electric Company will be a separate California corporat= ion focused on providing electric and natural gas distribution service to i= ts customers in Northern and Central California. It will hold 70 percent o= f the current utility assets (in terms of book value) and will employ 16,00= 0 people. Pacific Gas and Electric Company will continue to provide the fu= ll range of utility services to one out of every 20 Americans. =20 ?=09PG&E Corporation, in addition to its existing National Energy Group bus= iness, will have three new businesses that will own and operate the electri= c generation, electric transmission and gas transmission operations formerl= y under Pacific Gas and Electric Company.=20 The new electric generation business will be a California company establish= ed to own and operate the hydroelectric and nuclear generation assets and a= ssociated lands, and to assume the power contracts with irrigation district= s, now held by the utility. In total, the unit will have approximately 7,1= 00 megawatts of generation. The facilities will be operated in accordance = with all current FERC and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licenses, and in ke= eping with sound environmental stewardship policies. The generating busine= ss will sell its power back to the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Com= pany under a 12-year contract at a stable, market-based rate.=20 The new electric transmission business will be a California company establi= shed to own and operate the transmission system currently operated by the u= tility. The system comprises 18,500 circuit miles of electric transmission= lines and cables. The new gas transmission business will be a California company established = to own and operate the natural gas transmission assets currently operated b= y the utility, including 6,300 miles of transmission pipelines and three ga= s storage facilities. =20 Following the reorganization, the California Public Utilities Commission wi= ll continue to regulate the reorganized Pacific Gas and Electric Company, i= ncluding retail electric and natural gas rates. The Federal Energy Regulat= ory Commission (FERC) will continue to have jurisdiction over the licenses = for the hydroelectric assets, and the rates, terms and conditions of servic= e provided by the electric transmission business. FERC will also assume ju= risdiction over rates for the power generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear = Power Plant, and over the rates, terms and conditions of service for the ga= s transmission system, which will become an interstate pipeline. =20 Glynn said, "This plan, without raising retail rates, provides a safe, reli= able and long-term electric supply to California customers. It enables our= company to maintain a qualified workforce. And it enables us to keep our = generating assets intact and integrated, rather than selling them piecemeal= to pay creditors." The company expects that roles and responsibilities for the vast majority o= f its workforce will be unaffected by the plan. The reorganized Pacific Gas= and Electric Company and the newly established entities will employ essent= ially the same people who operate the various assets under the current orga= nization.=20 "We envision essentially the same experienced, dedicated team continuing to= do their jobs with a comparable level of pay and benefits programs," said = Glynn. "We believe these businesses should be operated and maintained by t= he people who know how to run them best." In addition to resolving creditors' claims and maintaining stability for cu= stomers and employees, the plan also provides long-term benefits to the sta= te. It provides the state with a path to exit the business of buying power= for customers, by identifying conditions under which Pacific Gas and Elect= ric Company would be financially able to re-assume the procurement responsi= bility that is currently being fulfilled by the state Department of Water R= esources. The Chapter 11 process requires that the plan of reorganization ultimately = be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court before it can be implemented.=20 Paul Aronzon, legal counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Credito= rs, said "This plan provides a comprehensive and responsible framework to r= esolve creditors' claims and restore PG&E's creditworthiness. It has our f= ull support, and we look forward to an expeditious resolution of the Chapte= r 11 process."=20 "With this plan filed," said Glynn, "we are now focused on bringing the Cha= pter 11 process to completion, reaffirming the financial health and creditw= orthiness of our operations through this reorganization, restoring customer= s' confidence, and rebuilding value for our shareholders." - 30 - At 10:00 AM Pacific Time today, PG&E Corporation and Pacific Gas and Electr= ic Company will discuss the plan of reorganization on a conference call for= members of the media.

Attemps are still underway to persuade the California PUC not to suspend DA at today's meeting. However, the best information we have at this time is that the PUC will suspend DA today, but will not suspend DA retroactively. As best we can tell, if the PUC suspends, it will suspend DA effective today, September 20th. In addition, there is a considerable effort underway--from both ends of the spectrum--to persuade the PUC to reject 1) the proposed rate agreement between the PUC and DWR and 2) the proposed "revenue requirement" that DWR submitted to the PUC. We'll report back with the results of the PUC business meeting as soon as we hear them. Best, Jeff

Harry: Could you forward along to the EES folks we talked to yesterday who're interested in ISO's demand-side proposal. Thanks. Best, Jeff Market Participants, Attached is the California ISO's revised third RFB for Loads with emergency back-up generators that wish to participate in the ISO Demand Relief Program (DRP). The ISO would especially like to thank the participants that submitted bids that included back-up generators into the first DRP RFB and encourages those participants to submit bids for this revised RFB. As mentioned in the March 30 Market Notice for the second DRP RFB (for Loads not using back-up generators), the design of the back-up generator program has changed somewhat since the issuance of the first DRP RFB. Loads using back-up generators will still be dispatched after the DRP Load blocks but will be available for 24 hours per month, similar to the Load portion. Successful bidders will start in the program either June 1 or July 1 depending on how quickly contracts and logistics can be finalized. Bids are due to the ISO on May 1 in accordance with the attached RFB. This RFB will also be posted on the ISO Home Page (www.caiso.com) in the next 24 hours. <<DRA Third RFB BUG 010403.doc>> - DRA Third RFB BUG 010403.doc
Mark: I don't know how any "concerns" I may have raised reached you, but rest assured that there are no worries from my end. I saw the piece on the local news. Vacar's on a one-person crusade to kill capitalism, that's certain. It was very clear that you were taken horribly out of context, and they did you a great disservice. Just between us chickens, it did come up as if you were implying that there's some reasonable likelihood that manipulation's the culprit. You can imagine just how sensitive we are to that issue. But I don't think that you should sweat it. In a very brief conversation with Mike Day I mentioned the piece and that they got you responding to manipulation (i.e., "when'd you stop beating your wife) on camera. So agitated was I that I didn't even bother to bring it up with Herr Fawcett. So again, thanks much for the note, but no big deal. Now for my two cents: Question: "what's the problem?" answer: "very bad state energy policy---and here are the five big regulatory problems standing in the way of a solution for California....." "market manipulation? well, those charges are raised in every industry, whenever prices spike. the lion's share of the time, it turns out to be market fundamentals." Appreciate your note. Thanks.

(PR); Comnes, Alan; Badeer, Robert; Williams III, Bill; Mallory, Chris; Denne, Karen; Belden, Tim; Yoder, Christian; Sanders, Richard B. Subject: As the CAISO Turns: CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWR's long-term contracts Everyone, This is hot news showing that the CAISO/CDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought. I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention. 1. According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an "Out Of Market" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff. The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions. 2. This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first. CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d). Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market ("OOM") energy. If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00. Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR. 3. By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market. Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices. The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00. Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free. If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it. 4. While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis. Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers). The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low. Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts. Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO. 5. The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00. These SCs are in for a big surprise. According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy. (Where is the price mitigation here?) 6. Who benefits under this scam? Davis and CDWR. Who loses under this scam? In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy. 7. Sources: Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and "the Friday Burrito," an industry insider publication mentioned it also. 8. Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito: "There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, "The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets." 9.

(Legal) Cc: DL-Portland Volume Mgmt Subject: 487 Revelation Steve, Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487. Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero. This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO. His response was this: that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS. In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS. -Kit
there was a strong case for that. only thing preventing was the internal DCF of the time-warner deal being 183-212 (or something)---so why didn't the market put that value on it? I went with what i thought the flow of the group was, but it was a tough row to hoe. where were you on it?

Susan Scott is a senior attorney with the pipeline group (TW). I met her as part of the California PUC's gas restructuring case. For some time she's been inquiring about Government Affairs. She called me yesterday and mentioned that she's very interested in exploring if there are any opportunities in GA. From my experience, Susan is highly competent and very professional and I think TW would say the same. She likes her work but wants a new challenge. I told her I'd inquire about whether someone would be interested in talking with her. I think that it would be useful for you to chat with her. Thoughts? Susan would like to keep it confidential at this point.

Joseph and I have begun (barely) to plan for this year's festivities. But before we get to far along, tried and true democratic (small "d") principles call for a wee bit of polling. Because we're already in the middle of October we need your responses pronto. If we don't receive your responses by COB Thursday, then democracy's out the window, and good ol' dictatorship takes over. Of course, it will be difficult to grant everyone's wishes, but all suggestions will be given great (and equal) weight. Here are the questions: Would you prefer just dinner, or dinner plus an activity? Joseph and I are leaning toward dinner and an activity, but wanted to hear from other folks. If yes, Joseph has come up with a couple of very fun ideas for an activity but suggestions are greatly encouraged and welcome. Same goes for a restaurant (understanding that the choice of activity may influence where we eat). Sue has put in her vote for Fleur de Lys. Should we try to organize the event with the rest of the SF office (i.e., EES and ENA) or confine it to GA? Should we expand to include Western GA or keep it to SFGA? We choose for dates the 7th or 8th or 14th or 15th of December. What's your preference. Is there a day that just won't work? Joseph, if I've missed anything, please tack on. Best, Jeff

The legislation, as currently drafted, would not undertake a wholesale adoption of the TURN proposal to transfer all undercollections from the TRA to the TCBA. Mike is trying to get hold of any analysis which was done which shows what the current balances in the TCBA and TRA would have been if TURN's proposal had been in place from day one. I know we put a halt on undertaking that analysis when we learned that TURN was doing it for their testimony. However, Mike seems to think getting something like that before the legislature in the next few days may be critical. If we had to undertake it, how long would it take to get a product? I have a call into Bob Finkelstein to see if they have already done the analysis, but have not heard back. Jeanne

To show that the job is never ending, please see attached yesterday's column 1 story in the WSJ. Best, Jeff August 22, 2001 Page One Feature For Montana Power, a Broadband Dream May Turn Out to Be More of a Nightmare By BILL RICHARDS Special to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL BUTTE, Mont. -- This is a gamblers' town. More than a century ago, Marcus Daly turned a bet on a copper vein under Butte into the giant Anaconda Co. The gambling game Keno was invented here for bored miners. In 1974, stuntman Evel Knievel, a Butte native, made headlines betting -- unsuccessfully -- that he could jump the Snake River Canyon on his rocket-powered motorcycle. Now, Bob Gannon, another Butte native, and chairman and chief executive of Montana Power Co., is betting he can pull off his own breathtaking stunt: He plans to turn his staid 89-year-old utility into a high-tech high-flier. [gannon] In one dizzying two-year stretch, the Butte-based utility has sold just about all its assets -- power plants, transmission lines, dams, gas, coal and oil fields -- pouring much of the $1.6 billion take into a coast-to-coast fiber-optic network. By the end of this year, Mr. Gannon boasts, Montana Power will have 26,000 miles of fiber in the ground, a new corporate name, Touch America, and it will be among the nation's largest half-dozen broadband companies. So far, Mr. Gannon's gamble seems to be following the same trajectory as Mr. Knievel's. The joke around here is that at least Mr. Knievel wore a parachute. Indeed, while plenty of companies have been hammered by the telecommunications bust, few have taken a more severe beating than Montana Power. Under Mr. Gannon's leadership, the company sold out of the energy business just as electric rates were taking off and bought into broadband as it was poised to tank. Now, only 5% to 10% of Touch America's fiber is being used. Mr. Gannon's makeover of the venerable utility has touched off warfare here, pitting Montana Power against regulators, investors, consumer advocates and its own former corporate customers. The company's stock, which hit a high of $65 a share five days after Mr. Gannon announced his decision to dump the utility business in March of last year, has spiralled downward since. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday, it was at $7.90. The decision by Montana Power's board to authorize a 6.6 million share buyback during the plunge didn't boost Mr. Gannon's image either. The spree cost the company $204.8 million; the purchased shares are now valued at about $52 million. But perhaps most galling to Montanans are the huge gains made by PPL Corp., the Pennsylvania utility that bought Montana Power's electric generating plants. PPL has sold nearly a third of the plants' power out-of-state at a huge markup, producing record profits. Meanwhile, state utility regulators, angry at Mr. Gannon's refusal to share proceeds of the asset sale with customers, have locked his company into a painful contract: Montana Power is required to continue supplying power to its 288,000 customers until 2007, even though it owns no more power plants. That has forced the company to purchase electricity from PPL. Montana Power, which is barred from raising customer rates, has been losing money on the transactions. Long, Expensive Fight The five-member utility commission could decide to let Montana Power boost its rates next year. But the high price of providing power has already drained the company's coffers. To cut back on its expenses, Montana Power agreed in June to pay $62.5 million to cancel the last year-and-a-half of a long-term supply contract with one of its biggest commercial customers, Butte-based Advanced Silicon Materials. Last week, in an unusual lawsuit filed in state district court in Helena, eight Montana Power shareholders charged the utility, its board, and its senior executives and consultants with a "breach of fiduciary duty" for failing to get shareholders' approval for the company's transformation. The suit seeks a rollback of Mr. Gannon's makeover, charging the effort has cost shareholders $3 billion. It also seeks to return to shareholders what it calls PPL's "illegal" gains from power sales. "We're trying to salvage the pension funds of thousands of Montanans who are wrapped up in this company," says Frank Morrison Jr., a former state Supreme Court justice and one of the attorneys filing the suit. Six of the state's largest law firms collaborated on the suit, Mr. Morrison says, "because we anticipate a long, expensive fight." Montana Power would not discuss its reasons for not seeking shareholder approval for the makeover but says it has done nothing wrong and will defend itself vigorously. All this has tattered Mr. Gannon's reputation as a hometown genius. Just last year, Wall Street analysts and media praised his bold makeover plan. He was cheered during the company's annual meeting, a folksy conclave held at Butte's Mother Lode Theater that is part business session, part homecoming party. More than a third of the company's registered shareholders live in Montana. But this year, angry shareholders and customers have picketed the company's headquarters, and Web sites are springing up across the state to rally voters to punish Montana Power. Earlier this month, Michelle Lee, a Democratic legislator from Livingston, launched Dumpthedeal.com (www.dumpthedeal.com a Web site urging a referendum to repeal deregulation of the electric industry in Montana. She says the site drew more than 1,000 visitors in its first two weeks. "A lot of people here just can't believe what's happened to Montana Power,'' says Ralph McCaughy, who retired from the company's data-processing department three years ago. Mr. McCaughy, who is 62 years old and has throat cancer, says he and his wife, Jean, had planned to use some of their Montana Power shares and dividends to buy a new car to replace their wheezy 1993 Honda and take a trip to Hawaii. Montana Power stopped paying dividends last year as part of the makeover. Mr. McCaughy says his spending plans are on hold. "I don't know whether Gannon and the bunch running the company couldn't stop themselves or what," he says. Enduring Hecklers These days, strangers sometimes blow raspberries and heckle Mr. Gannon during his daily two-block trek from his office to Gamer's, a local luncheonette that features a Butte specialty -- pork-chop sandwiches. The fact that Montana Power -- always one of the state's most powerful political forces -- led the lobbying drive for deregulation in the state hasn't helped his popularity. Deregulated electricity prices soared so high here last summer that several large Montana companies that had elected to buy power on the open market closed or cut back operations. Steven Walsh, president of Montana Resources, which operates part of Anaconda's open-pit mine in Butte, says he shut the mine and laid off 322 people last summer after his electricity bill jumped to $627 a megawatt hour from $26 an hour in a week. Prices have begun to come down, but the mine is still shut. "I don't hold any animosity toward Bob Gannon," Mr. Walsh says. "But around here I guess the general feeling is they made a big mistake." Despite the company's battered stock price, some Wall Street analysts say they still have hope for the transformation, and they note that Touch America -- which expects to have $1.6 billion in assets, including $350 million in cash -- has a stronger balance sheet than most of its telecom competition. Defending His Position Mr. Gannon denies rumors that he has been punched out in several Butte bars, but Montana Power's Internet message boards are sizzling with rants by angry investors threatening to show up at this year's Sept. 14 annual meeting with tar, feathers, or worse. "Bob's a decent human being and I still like the guy," says Paul Cote, the owner of Gamer's. "But I have heard people bad-mouthing him. There's a lot of people upset with him right now." Mr. Gannon, who can see the house where he grew up -- beyond the Hock-It-To-Me pawnshop -- from his office window, defends his makeover decision. Energy deregulation during the late 1990s doomed smaller regional utilities such as Montana Power, he says, while fiber optics was becoming a glamour industry. The company had begun laying fiber-optic lines in the 1980s. As the business began to take off in the 1990s, Mr. Gannon and others believed they had a solid head start. "There's a lot of second-guessing taking place now," he says. "But we were the ones sitting in the chair, and we made a decision that was absolutely correct and justified." Others blame Montana Power's problems on overreaching by Mr. Gannon and the utility's management, as well as on strong salesmanship by Goldman Sachs, Montana Power's investment bankers. Critics of the deal have suggested that Montana Power's 11-member board -- stocked with seven Montanans -- might not have fully appreciated the risks and challenges of the fiber-optic business. "They were intoxicated by their stock price and Wall Street was telling them, 'Hey, you're on a roll,' " says Robert Anderson, a Public Service Commission member. "These were utility guys. What did they know about the telecommunications business?" Mr. Gannon and other senior officials who were part of the Policy Leadership Group, a Montana Power internal decision-making team, say that until shortly before last year's makeover announcement they hadn't decided to turn Montana Power into a telecom. At first, Mr. Gannon says, the group had been "comfortable" with a more limited step: an initial public offering of the Touch America unit. The group also considered spinning off Touch America to Montana Power's shareholders or continuing to build it up within the company, he says. Goldman Sachs, which has worked with the utility for 17 years, urged the company's management to drop its power business entirely, company officials say. Goldman specialists from New York, Los Angeles and Chicago made more than 100 visits to Butte, camping at the Copper King Motel and advising the utility executives on their options. As the discussions went on, company officials say, divestiture of the power business seemed the most logical choice. Mr. Gannon and others say Goldman's bankers warned that the IPO market was losing its luster and urged them to sell their power-making assets quickly to get the best price. Matt Darnell, a Goldman managing director who advised Montana Power on its move toward telecommunications, declines to give specifics of Goldman's recommendations to either the policy group or Montana Power's board. "There were numerous options explored," he says, "but we certainly supported the thoughtful and deliberative approach the board took." Of the subsequent downward turn of events, Mr. Darnell says: "The telecommunications industry has taken a turn no one expected." For its advice, Goldman will get 2.5% of the gross payout from the asset sale, or about $14.2 million, a Montana Power spokesman says. Goldman officials say they are no longer advising Montana Power on its business plan. Mr. Gannon scoffs at the notion that his company made the wrong move. In a strongly worded letter last week, he urged shareholders to approve the final pieces of his makeover plan at the Sept. 14 annual meeting. He warned that if the shareholders rejected the measures, Montana Power's board would seek to accomplish the divestiture of the utility business through unspecified "other methods." Demand for fiber-optic networks will regain strength before long, Mr. Gannon says. When it does, Touch America could have an advantage over its debt-laden competition. Mr. Gannon says his company will emerge as one of the telecom industry's strongest national players, with no debt and a state-of-the-art technology. "There are a lot of suggestions in watering holes around this state that Goldman was flying around the West looking for a bunch of guys to dupe and that we were a bunch of rubes from Montana who got taken in," he says. "That's the stupidest thing I have ever heard." _____ -----Original Message----- From: Guerrero, Janel Sent: Wednesday, August 22, 2001 5:18 PM To: Shapiro, Richard; Palmer, Mark A.

Prior to June they appeared to be using a market based price for power, but in June the credit dropped to about $40/MWh which looks like utility-owned gen. We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits. I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is calculated. Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon as possible? Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want to discover there's a charge we don't know about.

We are trying to get folks who are dealing with the nuts and bolts issues, someone on the ground -- you get the idea - someone from Houston. Below are the details on the panel: Tuesday November 14th -- 1:30 p.m. - 3:00 p.m. Natural Gas Issues Issue: The future cost and availability of natural gas will become a dominant factor in the generation of electricity in California as more generation is built in future years. We have seen the natural gas price increase over 100% in the last fifteen months. Why has the price increased so dramatically? While the price increases can be expected to spur increased exploration and drilling, and this supply. Where can California expect to procure its natural gas supply and at what price over the next five to ten years? There are now some significant natural gas storage facilities coming on line - will they help hedge future price volatility? Are independent, unregulated generators concerned about our natural gas future? Who are the largest competitors to California for natural gas supply and what will be the role of new technology in increasing capture of new supply? Moderator: Keith McCrea Suggested Panelists: ____________, California Energy Commission (Fuels planner) ____________, El Paso Energy Corporation (Pipeline representative) ____________, Fuels Procurement, Calpine ____________, Enron ____________, Gas Storage Representative Ed Yates, CA League of Food Processors (customer perspective) Can you get back to me and let me know if and who could participate from Enron?

Best, Jeff Kurt Lindahl@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT 04/19/2001 01:13 PM To: Jeff Dasovich@EES cc: Michael Subject: California Interstate Pipelines Jeff, My name is Kurt Lindahl. I recently joined Enron Global Markets on the LNG team. I'm the Lead Developer for the West Coast and have been charged with building a (several) LNG terminal(s) on the west coast. Michael McGarry, from Enron Engineering and Operational Services Company, is the lead Development Engineer on the project. A key question in this effort is, "Where is the best entry point into the Socal/SG&E/PG&E pipeline systems. In other words, where can we site a LNG terminal and deliver natural gas into their systems, such that the amount of facilities they require is minimal? I spoke with Ben Asante who heads up the optimization department in ETS. He said that if we could get annual flow diagrams for the California intrastate systems, he could prepare a model in about 2 weeks time. Interstate pipelines have to file Annual Flow Diagrams at FERC, but I'm not sure what Intrastates' are obligated to file with the CPUC? That's where I need your help. This is a hot subject, because the race to site an LNG terminal is intense. Could you please call me at 713 345 5044 (O) or 713 515 2759 so that we can discuss. We want to keep this effort very confidential, so please maintain secrecy. I will also want to talk to you about permitting and state approvals. Regards, Kurt Lindahl

California Power-Buying Data Disclosed in Misdirected E-Mail By Daniel Taub Sacramento, California, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray Davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electricity market -- information Davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a misdirected e-mail. The e-mail, containing data on California's power purchases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. It was accidentally sent to some reporters on the office's press list, he said. Davis is fighting disclosure of state power purchases, saying it would compromise negotiations for future contracts. This week, Davis appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market invoices, purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signed through June 27. The state is buying electricity on behalf of utilities, which are burdened by debt. ``It's an internal document,'' Maviglio said of the e-mail. ``We have a meeting every morning where we discuss issues of the day.'' The e-mail contained minutes of today's meeting, he said. According to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of electricity for $37.4 million yesterday. One megawatt- hour is enough electricity to light 750 typical California homes for an hour. Prices ranged from $25 to $149.99 a megawatt-hour. Maviglio said the information in the e-mail is accurate. Power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a megawatt-hour on the California-Oregon border yesterday, according to Bloomberg Energy Service. California paid an average of $132 on the spot market, according to the e-mail. Prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on the day-ahead market. The governor has proposed releasing data on spot-market purchases once a quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying strategies tailored to each season. Lawyers for the media and Republican legislators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days after they are signed.

That would leave direct access in place and force DWR to come to us to get a bill that would have reasonable exit fee provisions. Without a change like this, the bill would simply reaffirm the ban on direct access and that could cause us to lose at the Commission. There is nothing else in the bill which explicitly tells the PUC to not suspend direct access.

Thanks for the summary. My comments and questions are indicated below. Please fax a copy of Plan B to be at 713 767 6677. You suggest starting the "process" in Sacramento next week. I'm not sure exactly what this means. Are we saying we will have a proposal or that we will be advocating a process/forum to get all the right parties at the table? Did we set a time for the next call on Friday? With regard to the Issues list, here are a few extra items: need to make clear that real price signals should be sent to all sectors (not just those that wouldn't vote for Davis anyway) as soon as possible I cannot imagine a situation in which the IOUs are returned to financial stability within 3-6 months; my guess is that it will be at least a year if IOUs are returned to the procurement role, we need to make sure that they have the appropriate risk management tools (ability to enter forward contracts, options, etc.) if IOUs are returned to the procurement role, we also need to have assurances that the situation we have today won't happen again; for example, if the state assigns the CDWR contracts to the IOUs and three years from now the market price is less than the contract price, what assurances does anyone have that the PUC will not try to make the IOUs absorb the difference If we want to go to a core/non-core approach, why do we need to wait 18-24 months; it seems to me that we could start that process now As for legal claims and investigations, we need to make clear that we want to resolve all state and federal claims; the civil claims present a different set of challenges for resolution as for discounts on receivables, I'm not ready to commit one way or another; however, if there are discounts they must apply to all market participants - not just the ones that Davis can get to the table.

Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc. Others who were on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything. Best, Jeff SUMMARY Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors). On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate. A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops. Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for however long it takes to work out a resolution. It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento. It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week. There was some discussion regarding the release today of "Plan B." Plan B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison. After that call I received a copy of "Plan B." If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number. Folks on the call agreed to have the next "supplier-only" call-in meeting on Friday. Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a "ratings agency level" presentation prepared by the end of the week. The goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates. The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff Item #1: The Credit Issue Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue. Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California PUC and CDWR. The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for power services delivered. If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow. Item #2: Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution. It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution. Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are. The following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a starting point for discussion. Utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs Increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process Decrease demand establish real-time pricing implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs Create a real market Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months) Return the procurement role to the utilities Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers Within 18-24 months, create a "core/noncore" market structure for electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, etc. Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc. Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)
Can you believe this?
The "big" meetings, which happen about every quarter, are de rigeur. The summer "big" meeting is an absolute must (and generally very fun). I'll be there. Hope you're there, too. Best, Jeff
Davis' deadlines on energy much easier set than met By Emily Bazar Bee Staff Writer (Published Feb. 23, 2001) Exactly one week ago, Gov. Gray Davis sounded hopeful, optimistic even, when he predicted that the state and its debt-ridden utilities would forge an agreement by today on a plan to save the companies from financial doom. Problem is, it won't work out that way. Negotiations between state officials and the investor-owned utilities have produced no comprehensive agreement to announce today. Davis' predictions during the energy crisis have been wrong before. For weeks, he has set deadlines for agreements and legislative action that haven't been met. On deadline days, even when there's little substantive progress to report, Davis often holds news conferences anyway -- many of them on Friday afternoons after financial markets close. The Democratic governor's office scheduled an "announcement" for today in Los Angeles, even though one utility representative said agreement is far away. Davis' actions have fueled speculation that he's trying to force consensus by setting artificial deadlines and putting a spin on the news, and tarnishing the state's credibility in the process. "I can't see how you would negotiate such a complex deal, like the purchase of the transmission grid, in such a short period of time. It doesn't seem realistic," said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of wholesale generators. "I guess the people I represent have turned it off. They have stopped listening. They hear it and say, 'OK, sure. Here's another photo op.' " Last Friday, Davis told a gathering of reporters that state officials and the utilities would agree by today on a rescue plan for the utilities. "I believe we'll have agreement before next week is out, on exactly what should go in a piece of legislation," he said at the time. "And hopefully, that legislation will be passed by the end of the following week." Legislative veterans said his comments were ill-advised and unrealistic. Davis met into the night Thursday with top officials of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., but no agrement was reached. "These are complicated problems that will not be solved overnight," said PG&E spokesman Ron Low. "On some issues, we are very far away from agreement." Sources said PG&E has been unwilling to negotiate sale of its transmission lines, which Davis has said is a necessary component of a deal. More progress was reported with the two other near-bankrupt companies -- San Diego Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison -- although sources said talks with them were far from concluded. Davis has been setting specific deadlines for himself and the Legislature for months: In November, the governor promised to present a comprehensive "plan" by Dec. 1 to stave off a full-blown energy crisis, but ended up offering only a modest slate of proposals. Davis called Feb. 12 a "drop dead" date by which he hoped to cement a deal between lawmakers and the utilities. There's no deal yet. Davis told reporters that he and the state's legislative leaders would reach a "consensus agreement" on the proposal to take to utilities by last Friday. It didn't happen; he made the announcement alone. Leon Panetta, a White House chief of staff under former President Clinton, said it's important that the governor set deadlines because the nature of politics is to delay. However, he cautioned against missing deadlines. "You have to be careful that you keep the deadlines you establish, because the more that you establish and not meet, the more that begins to lose its value as a political tool," Panetta said. The governor can't continue to indefinitely set deadlines without facing consequences, cautioned Steven Fetter, managing director of the Global Power Group at Fitch, a credit-rating agency based in New York. At some point, he warned, creditors and power suppliers may push the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, which would trigger an official deadline that can't be ignored. The dispute would be tied up in court at a judge's discretion. "Eventually, there is going to be a real deadline," Fetter said. "The problem is it's probably not a deadline that will be set by Gov. Davis. It's a deadline that will be set by the banks and the (electricity) suppliers." In several cases when deadlines haven't been met, Davis has held a news conference regardless, unveiling little new information and scant detail. On Jan. 26, for instance, the governor promoted the broad framework of a plan to save the utilities rather than a detailed plan that had been anticipated. One prong of the plan: "Aggressively promote energy efficiency, conservation and demand reduction among consumers, businesses and public entities." Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said that the governor continues to set deadlines because it's important to show that the state is making progress, particularly to Wall Street. He added that it's not the governor's fault the deadlines have been missed. "Many of the dates have been blown away by factors no one has been able to foresee or have control over: court decisions, actions by creditors, weather, you name it," Maviglio said. "The governor sets deadlines that continue to move the ball forward and he has been successful at doing that." Many of these announcements came after 2 p.m. on Fridays, triggering suggestions that the governor has attempted to spin the facts and manipulate the markets. Timing announcements after the close of East Coast financial markets is commonly used by politicians who don't want to send stocks soaring or tumbling by making an announcement, Panetta said. "You want people to evaluate what's happening so there isn't a panic reaction to a news flash going over the wire," he said. But market analysts say that ever since PG&E and Edison stocks plummeted in early January, the governor's statements haven't significantly affected their performance. "There has been so much news that has been so negative for the companies that I don't think it makes much of a difference," said Ed Schuller, a senior vice president for the full-service brokerage firm Sutro & Co. "It's beyond that point now."

I'll take a wild guess about what will be in the plan. 1. Marshall Law 2. Nationalize the grid. 3. International energy crimes trial.

RSP - SCE's Notice of Scheduled Individual Ex Parte Communication Meeting As indicated by this ex parte notice, Edison is planning to meet with Bilas this week before the continuation meeting on Thursday presumably to try to weaken his opposition to the July 1 cut off of direct access. Edison's comments on the proposed decision say that over 6% of their load has switched to direct access during the July 1 to September 6 time frame, resulting in a total of over 7% of load being served by direct access over their entire system at present. While it appears Bilas is still a strong proponent of allowing direct access and should still advocate reducing the DWR contract commitements instead of restricting customer options, should Enron, or AReM get in to see Bilas (and possibly Brown) to try to prevent any backsliding on the 13th. We have a right to a meeting with Bilas. A meeting with Brown would have to be noticed today or be held only with his advisor, Dave Gamson. I would recommend we try for both.

Bowne's staffer Lawrence Lingbloom took place on 3.2.01 to discuss fixing the DA prohibition in AB1X. About 30+ other interested parties attended. On 3.1.01 Bowen's office had distributed a complex proposal; and the meeting was convened to discuss the proposal. The proposal distributed by Lingbloom was unacceptable and rejected but at least it acknowledged the need to allow some level of DA, i.e., moved away from a complete prohibition on DA. After much discussion, Lingbloom left the meeting for a while, during which time the group engaged in a productive discussion with CDWR/CA Dept. of Finance. The group asked DWR/Finance if they could agree to a program that: a) treats bond financing costs as a nonbypassable charge designed to cover the period during which the customer consumed power subsidized and purchased by DWR; b) includes an exit fee for customers switching to DA if, and only if, there are actual costs associated with power contracts signed by DWR that might be "stranded"; c) permits an open season for "free switching" to DA when demand exceeds the sum of DWR's firm contract portfolio, retained generation and QF cost. This would mean that the amount of load covered by DWR's spot purchases, plus new load growth, should not face restrictions on Direct Access. DWR wanted to include an agreement on information exchange, which might include noncore customers advising DWR in advance when they will switch to DA. In return, DWR offered to post information about their power contracts and terms AFTER contracts were executed. Enron's outside attorney is drafting language to capture the concepts discussed at the 3.2.01 meeting. The draft will be distributed and discussed on Monday, 3.5.01.
ah jeez, i guess this means that you made it back safely from s.d?

Both SoCalGas and PG&E sent a letter and email to to the full service list yesterday (Tues, 9/5) informing parties of this development. SoCalGas believes that some modification to the Comprehensive Settlement in necessary to take this development into account, and that we then need to file the modification as soon as possible with the Commission.? The ALJ has indicated to us that some formal filing with the Commission in response to this development will be necessary. We want to work with the signatories to the Comprehensive Settlement to reach a consensus as soon as possible.? Our goal is to cause little or no delay in the processing of a decision on the Comprehensive Settlement. What SoCalGas has in mind is modifying the settlement to remove the specific naming of Altra and to insert language saying that SoCalGas will select and contract with a third-party provider for a specified period of time, without identifying in the settlement who that will be.?? We also need to consider whether we should address in the revision to the settlement how we will handle the possibility that the third-party provider will not be ready to operate by the April 1, 2001 date the settlement provides for the monthly imbalance trading, OFO day imbalance chip trading, and storage rights trading.? SoCalGas is looking at interim arrangements that it could provide in-house starting April 1, 2001, until the third-party provider could begin service.? We also might consider what would happen if no third party provider can be found. To avoid any claims that we have not complied with the settlement rules, today we mailed and emailed to the full service list a notice of a settlement conference for Wednesday of next week.? We want to file something with the Commission very promptly thereafter. Please feel free to contact Glen Sullivan at 619-699-5027, Lad Lorenz at 213-244-3820, Bob Betonte at 213-244-3832, or June Suwara at 213-244-3504 on this subject.? For those of you who have not heard, Brian Cherry has submitted his resignation from Sempra Energy's Regulatory Affairs Dept. and will be going to work shortly for PG&E in a similar capacity.
We will need to figure out for ourselves whether the EESI bond has been terminated or not. The PUC will only know well after the fact whether it's been terminated and only after they've received (usually after considerable lag) notice from the folks with whom we've got the bond that it's been terminated. What's the best way of researching/finding out whether the bond's current or has been terminated? Best, Jeff -----Original Message----- From: Steffes, James D.

FYI. See highlighted comments below. Don't know if you've heard, but there's considerable talk about Davis trying to get the bonds out via Executive Order. How that might work technically is unclear---at the end of the day, Lynch & Co. have to approve any ratepayer funds used to service the bonds. Perhaps Davis is thinking about shifting the burden to taxpayers generally. In off line conversations with JP Morgan people, they're saying the Executive Order route is "doable," but they ain't giving any details. We're trying to find out more. Alternative SDG&E debt plan to get hearings Approval of the governor's plan for paying the $747 million debt SDG&E says it is owed by its customers appeared less certain yesterday, as the president of the state utilities commission said she planned to hold public hearings for an alternative proposal. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said in a local radio interview that regulators will hold hearings in San Diego regarding a plan from consumer groups that purports to save customers about $185 million more than the governor's proposal. The groups said the earlier plan negotiated between the governor and the utility would be costly for consumers and a windfall for San Diego Gas & Electric. At stake is how much SDG&E contributes and how much customers pay toward the debt, which accumulated in a so-called balancing account when SDG&E paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers during the power crisis. Despite the plan for hearings, Lynch told KPBS-FM radio that the commission would make a final decision about how to resolve the controversial $747 million debt by November. The governor and SDG&E announced their plan in June, saying it required the utility to contribute $319 million toward the debt and eliminated the balancing account without lengthy litigation or raising rates. Consumer groups, led by the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, say the governor's plan does not go far enough, particularly because SDG&E earned an estimated $400 million in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis. Under the governor's plan, those profits are awarded to the company's shareholders, though SDG&E would use $219 million from the profits as part of its $319 million contribution toward the debt. Under the consumer groups' plan, SDG&E would be allowed to keep some of the profits, but it would contribute $72 million more than it would under the governor's plan. The alternative plan also would require the utility to make other monetary concessions. In a formal decision earlier this year, the California utilities commission said SDG&E's profits do belong to customers. SDG&E has sued to overturn the decision in court, but it has put the litigation on hold pending the utilities commission's resolution of the plan to pay the debt. Michael Shames, executive director of UCAN, said yesterday that he was encouraged by Lynch's call for hearings on the consumer plan. "There is $400 million at stake here," Shames said. SDG&E said yesterday that it had not received formal notification about the hearings, nor had it yet seen the alternative plan for paying the debt. A spokesman for the utility, however, repeated earlier comments that the company saw the alternative plan as an attempt to derail the PUC's process of considering the governor's plan. Lynch also said yesterday that the utilities commission would continue to challenge the more than $40 billion in long-term electricity contracts signed by the state during the crisis. Lynch said the agreements bind the state to overpriced power and are in violation of federal law requiring electricity rates to be "just and reasonable." The utilities commission president said the contracts may be even more expensive than earlier thought because at least some of the power they bind California to purchase is not needed. The extra costs would damage businesses and family budgets, she said. "If you have to pay three to four times more for energy, you don't have the money to grow your business or meet other needs of your family," Lynch said. She also defended action by the commission last week that effectively delayed the sale of $12.5 billion in state bonds needed to pay power costs. Lynch said the commission supported a legislative proposal for floating the bonds, which would separate them from the long-term power contracts.
To add to Bev's comments, I've gotten many calls from large customers today. I'll be meeting with them in Sacramento on Monday to discuss the core/noncore structure further and try to craft a core/noncore structure that makes sense. I've also asked Sandi and the Sacramento team to line up meetings with key legislators while I'm there to discuss the same. Business is, as was expected, very unhappy about that portion of the plan that would stick them with all of Edison's debts. They view it as unfair and punitive (which it is) and are frustrated that the Democrats would include it simply to "make the deal Harvey proof." Many questioned Keeley about why the Democrats are hell bent on pandering to Harvey. Keely said that the Assembly is also trying to come up with something that will get support from the Senate (read "Burton"). Keely also mentioned our name in a list of many names as sources of information used to build the proposal.

Lynch Urging July 1 DA Suspension Date FYI. Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy. Best, Jeff CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible. Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has been resolved. Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as well as 400 MW generated by wind. With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll, provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation. Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand side management, renewables and peakers.

Prior to June they appeared to be using a market based price for power, but in June the credit dropped to about $40/MWh which looks like utility-owned gen. We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits. I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is calculated. Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon as possible? Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want to discover there's a charge we don't know about.

Any auctions (in >any commodity) that would work? We are trying to get back to key policy >makers mid-day on Monday. Yes, there are numerous default service auction models in operation or proposed, both in electricity and other utilities. The government of New South Wales in Australia is implementing a model similar to this. In Georgia, I think they recently had an auction to serve customers served by a gas retailer that went bust. Similar mechanisms have been used for years in the telecoms business for serving specific client bases, such as rural customers. Examples have been in Chile, and even in the U.S. (auctions for "universal service obligations"). We proposed a model for "third-party" default service standard supply for Ontario (working for Aleck Dadson of Enron Canada). This allowed the standard supply provider to meet its obligation by competitive means, including holding an auction. The idea was to provide customers hedging in a framework that allowed for competition in default service. Let me know if you want a briefing or futher info.

I'm on vacation next week, but would be happy to get together first thing the following week to discuss. Also, in response to a voicemail that I received, wanted to let folks know that the CPUC did not hold gas hearings today. The legislature is, however, holding hearings, taking a "comprehensive view" of the industry (i.e., focusing on specific allegations of pipeline capacity "price gouging"). They held their first hearing today, but it got cut short due to activities underway in the Legislature. I believe that, prior to cutting the hearing short, the Legislature only made it through two panels of customers, who told stories of skyrocketing bills and associated hardship. One panel participant (Anastacio Andrade of Sunrise Mushrooms, I believe) waived an EES bill and described how it tripled between November and December. I have a feeling that the Legislature's actions may be prompting the PUC to appear that it's doing something. I'll report more on the Legislative hearings as they occur.

By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES SAN DIEGO (Dow Jones) -- David Freeman, seen a likely replacement for Marcie Edwards on the board of governors of the California Independent System Operator, said his first order of business would be to try and merge the ISO and the California Power Exchange. Edwards resigned her post on the ISO Thursday. An informal consensus among the board has already approved his membership. Freeman told Dow Jones Newswires that the $250 per megawatthour wholesale power price cap in California is too high, and that he would like to see it reduced below $100/MWh. "I think my role (on the board) will help the state solve it's serious generation shortage problem," Freeman said. Some market participants said Freeman is expected to run for chair of the ISO's board of governors, a seat currently held by Jan Smutny-Jones. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power has this summer been able to sell the ISO power in the real time market, and make a great profit for itself in return. By Jason Leopold (323)658-3874.

Jan and//or Katie and I have been attending these meetings. Since Jan has been in Washington DC we have rescheduled some of the more important meetings for when he is back in town next week. In general the meetings fall into two categories and seem to be defined by party affiliation. While this may not be everyone's experience, our experience so far has showed that many of the Republicans have embraced our message and are offering to lend support where they are able. Many of the Democrats have demonstrated extreme caution, are interested in our message, but offering little or no support. The major theme for them is what they can take back to their districts. The one exception on the Democratic side so far has been Senator Machado who has requested IEP draft language on long-term contracting. Senator Bill Morrow (R) has requested assistance in drafting language on the NIMBY siting issue, which we agreed to do so. We have agree to assist both. From hereon, we will focus on our meeting efforts on the new Assembly ECA committee members and "meet and greets" with the new members in both the Assembly and the Senate. Because this meeting list was changing on an hourly basis, it was impossible to forward to Board members. Please be sure, if you haven't already, to send us a list of your representatives so we can contact you when a meeting with them has been confirmed. -- Assembly U&C staff organized a meeting with the CEC and generators with repower projects. Generators in attendance included representatives from Duke, Dynegy, Southern, AES and Sunrise (Williams was there but didn't speak). After each of the participants airing their grievances, we were tasked with developing language, getting the generating industry to support it and supporting it in the legislative process. We were given until Friday to hand in bill language to the U&C staff. Such a commitment comes with many promises and pitfalls which shuld be discussed next week on a conference call which IEP will be setting up. -- As reported in an e-mail yesterday, the first two special session bills passed out of the new Assembly Energy Costs and Availability (ECA) committee yesterday (ABX 5 and ABX6, both attached, but amended versions not in print yet). Both measures also passed off the Assembly floor today and are on their way to the Senate for consideration in the Senate Energy Committee. Members of that committee have not yet been announced. -- The Governor had a press conference today to announce a plan to reduce California's energy use by at least five percent within a week. During the Q&A portion of the press conference the Governor suggested the three members of the new ISO Board should be the President of the CPUC, and the Chairs of the EOB and the CEC. UPCOMING EVENTS: -- The Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee is having an informational hearing on Tuesday, January 16th at 1:30 pm in room 4202.

Rather than acknowledge that he was wrong, Robert is on a witch hunt.

Please call me after you have had a chance to review it. Thanks. Regards, Lara FTC Requests Comments on Retail Electricity Competition Plans The Federal Trade Commission today announced that it is seeking information regarding the results to date of different regulatory approaches to the introduction of competition into the retail sale of electricity. The Commission has approved a Federal Register notice, to be published shortly, that contains a series of questions designed to help gather this information. The Commission will produce a report that discusses the advantages and disadvantages associated with different approaches to particular issues and that identifies, if warranted, areas in which additional federal legislative or regulatory action may be desirable. As detailed in the notice, many states have enacted, and in some cases begun to implement, legislation designed to introduce competition into the retail sale of electricity to encourage lower prices, better service and greater innovation. To date, 24 states and the District of Columbia have set dates when customers will be allowed to choose their electric power supplier. Recently, however, substantial price increases and reliability problems in some areas undergoing this transition have raised questions about the best way this restructuring can be designed to benefit retail customers. In light of recent price increases and reliability problems in California and western states generally, some states have delayed, or are considering delaying, implementation of retail competition plans. The Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee of the United States House of Representatives, W.J. "Billy" Tauzin, and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality, Joe Barton, have requested that the Commission examine various state retail competition programs and describe those features that appear to have resulted in consumer benefits and those that have not yielded consumer benefits. In addition, the Commission has been asked to examine possible jurisdictional limitations on the states' authority to design successful retail competition plans and whether there is a need for federal legislative or regulatory action. To comply with this request, the Commission will update its July 2000 staff report "Competition and Consumer Protection Perspectives on Electric Power Regulatory Reform." For the updated report, the Commission proposes to examine state plans that allow customers to choose their generation supplier, and state plans with unique approaches to retail electricity competition. The Commission will work with the states to understand the various features of the plans and to gather facts relevant to understanding the market reaction to a particular state's plan. The Federal Register notice contains additional questions about which the Commission seeks public comment. The Commission seeks comments on features of state retail competition plans that have benefitted consumers and those that have not. The Commission is particularly interested in receiving information about the market response to various provisions of state retail competition plans. It is not necessary to respond to each question for every state. Written comments in response to the questions in the Federal Register notice are due by April 3, 2001 and will become part of the public record. They may be submitted to: Donald S. Clark, Office of the Secretary, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580. Submissions should be captioned: "V010003 -- Comments Regarding Retail Energy Competition." Electronic submissions may be sent by e-mail to: "retailelectricity@ftc.gov" and may also be sent on floppy disk, as described in the notice. The Commission vote to publish the Federal Register notice was 5-0. This is the FR Notice text from the FTC web site at

FYI. How to remedy the "PX only" flaw in California's market has been on the table for some time. I've felt for some time that the gas model offers a good point of departure for coming up with a more rationale alternative to the current framework. As mentioned in a previous note, I made that point at the California Energy Market conference last week. The EOB's chief economic consultant, who also spoke at the conference, was intrigued by my comments and has asked me to go up to Sacramento sometime in the next week or two to discuss it--and other options--with him. My understanding is that the idea coincidentally got some attention at the Wright meeting last week. With all of that in mind, I wanted to pass on a very brief summary of the gas procurement mechanisms currently in place for PG&E and SoCalGas that I asked Mike Day's shop to draft up last month. It might come in handy as prep for the call on Monday to discuss the Wright meeting.

The overall result is to reduce the capital revenue requirement by $24.8 million and expenses by $37.3 million. In addition, some portion of PG&E' estimated $171 million in electric distribution capital spending will be subject to rehearing. Listed below are the areas in which the Commission granted rehearing. 1. Electric Distribution Capital Spending. The Commission will, in essence, reopen the record, and allow PG&E to put into evidence how much it invested in its electric distribution plant in 1998. PG&E had used a 1998 forecasted amt of capital expenditures to develop its test year forecast. TURN argued that there was substantial evidence on the record that this amount was never spent. PG&E argued that the record closed prior to the end of 1998 so the best it could do was an estimate. On rehearing, the Commission agreed with TURN, that there was evidence that the forecasted amount was never spent, so they are allowing PG&E to prove it. The rehearing order states that any rates that are raised based on the electric distribution capital forecast adopted the GRC decision may be subject to refund. 2. Emergency Response Work This work category under electric distribution capital spending was reduced by $17.2 million. 3. Vegetation Management. The Supplemental Tree Trimming Program was reduced by $9.2 million. 4. Meter Reading. PG&E had primarily used accounting changes to justify the large increase in this service. On rehearing the Commission stated that PG&E had failed to substantiate those changes and reduced the allowed amount by $7.9 million. 5. Account Services. On rehearing the commission stated that PG&E had failed to show (a) why it cost so much more to provide services to CIA customers than residential customers ( $43.30 vs. $10.20); and (b) that money was not going for marketing activities that the Commission had disallowed in the previous GRC. The result was that the commission disallowed $20 million. 6. Customer Information Systems. The Commission disallowed $7.2 million as funds which ratepayers had already expended for CIS rewrites for which they had not received any benefits.

By JASON LEOPOLD Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Independent System Operator is expected to file a petition with federal regulators Friday seeking authority to force generators to bid 70% of their supply into the forward market in an effort to reduce wholesale power costs in the state, according to a source familiar with the issue. An official with the state's Electricity Oversight Board confirmed the details of the filing. The filing calls for FERC to set a "just and reasonable" rate for a large fraction of suppliers' capacity, while remaining supply would be able to earn market-based rates, according to the source. In addition, major out-of-state generators would have to enter into forward contracts at FERC mandated rates for "a significant portion of their expected sales." ISO Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Winter will hold a news conference Friday morning that will focus on possible solutions to lower wholesale energy costs. He is expected to announce how bidding into the forward market will stabilize high wholesale power costs. The state's Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a similar filing with federal regulators in the near future, sources said. In addition, forcing generators to bid into the forward market is a measure that would reduce market power in the state and would protect a majority of utilities served by the generators from the cost impact of market power, the ISO has said in prior meetings. Market power is a term used by economists to describe how generators can influence power prices. According to an ISO report, market power occurred this past summer because tight power supply and concentration of generation ownership "allowed suppliers to be pivotal at relatively high demand periods." About 50% to 60% of the power purchased this past summer was done in the spot market, an unusually high percentage, according to the ISO. In order to mitigate market power, the filing calls for utilities to enter into two-year forward contracts with generators to shield against the daily market price fluctuations. Regulatory constraints associated with forward contracting was a "key source of high (power) costs in the summer of 2000," according to an ISO report. The ISO action will be taken without approval from a the grid operator's board of governors. Usually, a majority of the board is required to approve such an action. EOB Official Surprised By ISO Action The announcement of the ISO's expected filing came as a surprise to Gary Heath, executive director of the state's Electricity Oversight Board. Heath told Dow Jones Newswires he was aware of the filing and news conference. "We're trying to find out what's behind this," Heath told Dow Jones Newswires. "We're not sure if they could do this without board approval. It came as a surprise." Sources said the agency is holding the news conference in an attempt to eclipse imminent structural changes to the ISO expected to be proposed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next month. FERC launched an investigation into California's troubled power market this past summer based on allegations that the market isn't workably competitive and participants manipulate the market. Energy officials have blamed the ISO for this summer's power woes. -By Jason Leopold; Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874; (END) Dow Jones Newswires 20-10-00 0307GMT Michael E. Nix Michael E.

Thanks. Frank W Vickers@ECT 12/29/2000 12:46 PM To: Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Terry Donovan Subject: Response Jeff, we need to add some discussion focused on QF issues in California and how resolution to certain items would enhance QF ownership and provide the utilities with optimal performance of the QF's and perhaps encourage new capacity development at existing QF locations. The utilities should be motivated to enter into buyout, buydown, blend and extend, negotiate fixed energy prices and other restructuring transactions with the QF's. The utilites have the ability to hedge the floating price currently being paid to the QF's. They should be motivated to look into these structures. Utilities should provide some clarification to the energy prices under QF PPA's. There is alot of risks around SRAC and PX that affect both the utilities and the QF owners. It seems like resolution to that risk is beneficial to both the utility as well as the QF. QF's should have the ability to move excess capacity and energy into either the market and/or to the utility. That would create additional economic incentives for the QF's to run and perhaps increase their capacity. Frank

PUC and Edison Settle Federal litigation to maintain utility service without raising rates The California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and Southern California Edison (Edison) today reached a settlement in the Filed Rate Doctrine lawsuit Edison filed in federal court against the PUC. The settlement is intended to restore Edison to creditworthiness so that it is able to resume procuring the electricity needed by its customers; limit ratepayers' costs of paying off the debt; and maintain the state's role in regulating the investor owned utility by enabling Edison to pay down its back debts over a reasonable, certain period of time. The terms of the Settlement Agreement include: ? Edison will apply cash on hand, plus all of its revenue over recoverable costs, to paying off its back debt. The PUC and Edison have agreed that the amount of the back debt to be recovered from ratepayers is the amount of certain outstanding debt Edison had at August 31, 2001, less the cash on hand on that date, less an additional $300 million adjustment. The amount that will be paid down pursuant to the settlement agreement is estimated to be $3 billion as of the end of this month. The parties believe that the amount to be paid by ratepayers will be much less than the cap. ? Edison will not pay any dividends on its common stock through 2003, or on the full payment of its debt, if sooner. If Edison has not fully paid its back debt by the end of 2003, the Commission retains the discretion to determine whether Edison will pay a dividend in 2004. Edison is free to resume paying dividends in 2005. Since Edison's annual dividend has typically been about $400 million, Edison's shareholders will have forgone at least $1.2 billion in dividends and possibly more, in addition to the $300 million adjustment. ? Edison will apply 100% of any recovery it obtains from refund proceedings at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or litigation against sellers to pay down the back debt. Edison commits through court order to work with the PUC and the Attorney General in pursuing litigation against the energy sellers. ? The PUC can direct Edison to use $150 million each year for other utility purposes, including the provision of additional energy efficiency monies, which would otherwise be used to pay down the Edison debt. ? The PUC agrees not to lower Edison's retail rates below their current level through the end of 2003 unless the back debts are recovered. However, rates may be reduced as a result of a securitization of the debt or reduced DWR revenue needs. ? The PUC agrees to set rates not higher than the current rate, to enable Edison to recover the remaining amount of the back debt over 2004 and 2005 if Edison's back debt has not been recovered by the end of 2003. ? There are no concessions of PUC or State regulations or regulatory authority over Edison, nor is there any deregulation of valuable transmission and generation facilities. ? Edison may make up to $900 million in capital expenditures annually. "This settlement embodies a fair and judicious way for Edison to become solvent and get back in the business of buying power, while meeting the needs of ratepayers and the state of California," said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC. "The settlement also ensures that all of the benefits of any refunds arising through litigation against power generators and marketers that profited from unjust and unreasonable energy prices will benefit ratepayers." This agreement settles a November 2000 federal court lawsuit filed by Edison against the PUC, in which Edison claimed that the Commission's actions in not providing sufficient retail rates, violated federal law and was an unconstitutional taking of its property. Under this agreement, Edison will release the PUC from all claims in its lawsuit and will also withdraw any challenges to the Commission's decisions implementing AB 1X, AB 6X, and the TURN accounting proposal. -----Original Message----- From: Dasovich, Jeff Sent: Tuesday, October 02, 2001 4:42 PM To: Dasovich, Jeff; Kean, Steven J.; Belden, Tim; Sharp, Vicki; Blachman, Jeremy; Comnes, Alan; Tribolet, Michael; Walsh, Kristin; Delainey, David; Leff, Dan; Frazier, Lamar; Keeney, Kevin; Gahn, Scott; Swain, Steve; Lavorato, John; Kaufman, Paul; Steffes, James D.; Calger, Christopher F.; Mara, Susan; Black, Don; Richter, Jeff; Kitchen, Louise; Dietrich, Janet; Mara, Susan; Robertson, Linda; Kingerski, Harry; Denne, Karen; Palmer, Mark A.

This item was not on the Commission's agenda other than as a placeholder regarding "litigation." We do not have copies of the agreement but we just talked to Edison's SVP of Regulatory Affairs and here's a summary: The Commission will keep current rates in place through 2003 Any "overcollection" resulting from keeping current rates in place will go to paying off $3.3 B in Edison's past due accounts (the so-called "undercollection") If Edison collects the $3.3B prior to 2003, then rates can change If Edison has not collected the $3.3 B by the end of 2003, the PUC will create a dedicated rate component on all bills to collect the remainder. Half the remainder will be collected in 2004 and the other half in 2005. Any refunds received from litigation against suppliers will go to reducing the $3.3 B undercollection. Edison can keep 10% of any refunds received after the $3.3B is paid off. Edison cannot pay any dividends during the time that it is using rates to pay off the $3.3B. Edison can apply to the PUC for approval to hedge gas price risk. Edison will be protected from any increases in DWR contract costs (i.e., if DWR's costs go up, the PUC will raise rates rather than take it out of Edison's rates) The PUC will not fine Edison during this period if Edison's capital structure varies from the PUC-approved capital structure Edison must drop its lawsuits against the PUC regarding 1) the "filed rate doctrine" and 2) the so-called "TURN" accounting method, which effectively kept the rate freeze in place. Edison agrees to "cooperate" with the Attorney General and the PUC in all litigation against suppliers. The PUC decision could likely nullify the need for the "special" session that the Governor recently announced We will report back with additional details as soon as we get them.

The vote was 4-1, with the two Republicans voting with Davis' hand-picked appointees Lynch and Wood. Davis' proposal was introduced at the meeting by another Davis appointee--Geoff Brown--who made a lengthy speech about why California would experience economic and political destruction if the PUC did not approve Davis' proposed rate agreement. What is Davis' proposed rate agreement between DWR and the CPUC? It would remove all PUC authority to review any contracts between DWR with suppliers. It would require the PUC to pass through to utility rates all DWR power contract costs, no questions asked. What are the implications of the move by the PUC to reject Davis' proposal? With the vote, it remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the DWR power contracts. The political pressure to re-negotiate--or break--the DWR power contracts is likely to intensify considerably. It remains unclear how California/DWR will pay for the $12.5 B in bonds the Treasurer has unsuccessfully attempted to issue for past several months. Under the structure devised by Davis, the revenues flowing from the CPUC/DWR rate agreement would be used to both 1) pay for the DWR power contracts and 2) service the bonds the Treasurer is trying to issue to repay California's General Fund for spot and other short term power purchased by DWR since January. In short, there is no clear indication of how California will pay for DWR contracts or issue the bonds. Safe to say that today's PUC vote has seriously embarrassed Davis, and left his approach to "solving" California electricity crisis in shambles. What Next? A broad left-right coalition of energy interests supported a bill (18XX) that passed the Legislature with broad bi-partisan support. The bill would create a "dedicated rate component" on every customers bill to service the $12.5 B in bonds that the Treasurer wants to issue. Proponents of the bill--and just about everyone else--argue that the "dedicated rate component" is a signficantly more efficient way to raise the debt California needs to plug the hole in its budget. The bill is silent, however, on how California would pay for the DWR contracts, and the bill's opponents claim that the power suppliers will sue as a result. All four PUC commissioners who voted against the Davis rate agreement today urged Davis to sign the bill. The left-right coalition (from Nader types to oil companies) is also working hard to get Davis to sign it. Davis has said that he will veto the bill on the advice of the Treasurer and bond counsel. Given today's vote, however, Davis may have no alternative than to sign the bill if he wants to get the bonds issued and the state budget repaid. Update on Edison Bailout Still appears that chances are very small that Edison and Davis will succeed in getting the Legislature to vote for an Edison bailout when it returns for another "special" session next Tuesday. If you have any questions, just let us know. Best, Jeff

FYI. Just got a call from Jan Smutney-Jones. Apparently, word is on the street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the "misconduct" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets. Smutney thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the "unnamed" trader in the Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it. Apparently Peace's other angle is/will be: "The same people who colluded in the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it." No idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks. Two immediate thoughts: Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state (SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government. David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed "Czar" by the State of California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain child (AB 1890). Freeman set up the ISO and PX market structures. He also set up the Governing Boards.
Greetings: Sounds like I'm glad that I missed the quiz last week. Hate to be a nag, but we've got to turn in what we're doing for our project on Thursday. I propose doing a nice, clean merger, which would allow us to do both comparative analysis (who are these companies?) and merger/valuation analysis. Mark and I talked last night and I pleaded again not to do strict accounting stuff, but if that's what folks would like to do, I can certainly suck it up. Any thoughts? Best, Jeff

Given that we are already well into the Summer of '01, it now appears that further CDWR contracting will only lock CA into high prices. The original idea was that CDWR could buy power at $80/mwh and ensure that retail rates wouldn't go higher. Neither of these concepts have held true. I think that Enron needs to consider actively oppossing any further contracting and a bond issuance in light of the potential harm that CDWR will do. First, the prices they are getting won't be great for customers. Second, with the "new" stranded costs that will be created, direct access in the future won't have a chance. Appreciate everyone's thoughts? Jim

----- Forwarded by Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron on 06/26/2001 04:35 PM ----- Much Calif Power Price Gouging Beyond FERC's Reach -ISO Updated: Monday, June 25, 2001 06:59 PM ET Email this article to a friend! Printer-friendly version By Jason Leopold Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators only have the authority to order refunds for about a third of the $9 billion California Gov. Gray Davis claims energy companies have overcharged the state in the 12 months to May 2001, documents from the state's wholesale market operator show. Of the total, $2.9 billion came from the May-September period the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has said it can't act on, and $2.8 billion from the October-May period is attributable to municipal utilities over which FERC lacks jurisdiction, according to documents from the California Independent System Operator. That leaves just $3.3 billion in alleged overcharges that FERC could potentially order refunded - far less than the $9 billion Davis seeks. Talks between generators and state officials to settle billions of dollars in unpaid bills and issues of overcharging began Monday. Curtis Wagner, the FERC administrative law judge presiding over the talks, has said California will likely see refunds from generators, but far less than the $9 billion Davis expects. Davis said Sunday California is going to Washington, D.C., "with one goal, and that is to bring back $9 billion." Nearly half that amount is attributable to municipal utilities, the ISO documents show. The ISO said the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, for example, overcharged California $75 million between May and October. David Freeman, the governor's chief energy adviser and the former general manager of the LADWP, said the agency didn't overcharge the state, but conceded it profited by selling spare power to the ISO. Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said the state needs FERC to lay the groundwork for the state to seek refunds from public utilities by ordering refunds from corporate energy suppliers. But during a conference call Sunday with reporters, McFadden and Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio couldn't explain how the governor would go about getting refunds from companies whose wholesale power prices aren't regulated by FERC. Davis testified before the U.S. Congress last week that generators overcharged the state $9 billion and that FERC should order the refunds. State Sen. Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, has asked for an investigation into Davis's testimony, saying the figures were based on "shaky calculations." To come up with its conclusions, the ISO compared hourly market prices received by sellers to an estimate of market prices that could have been expected under competitive market conditions. The ISO established a benchmark for what it determined was competitive - at times about $125 per megawatt-hour to $200/MWh, a fraction of actual prices in the market - based on the cost of natural gas and compliance with air-quality rules. The ISO, however, typically used the price of gas at California's northern border, according to the documents. Generators paid a higher price for the fuel in Southern California, raising the cost of making electricity. The ISO also used reports of earnings by the state's "Big Five" power suppliers during 2000 - earnings that for some quadrupled - to draw the conclusion that generators overcharged the state, according to the documents. The ISO attributed high power prices in part to the state's three largest utilities' failure to buy the power they needed in advance, leaving the grid operator to pick up the shortfall at the last minute, according to the documents. The ISO alleges the following companies overcharged the state by the listed amounts between May 2000 and February: American Electric Power Service Corp.

The group's shooting to have a first cut at a "straw person" proposal sketched out by end of next week. The group's meeting on Tuesday to continue to bounce around ideas. I'd like to try to have an internal call on Monday at either 10 AM (PST) or 3 PM (PST) to pin down at least a vaguely detailed conceptual framework that I can propose to the subcommittee on Tuesday. The agenda items for the internal meeting are: Finalize proposal for benchmark(s) for utility procurement. Goal: increase utility willingness to enter into forward contracts by replacing PUC after-the-fact "reasonableness" review with a benchmark. (Been working the Portland desk on a "portfolio benchmark" concept.) Determine our view of how to treat term contracts w.r.t. the PX credit, i.e., should those contracts be disclosed to the market, or should PUC keep them confidential, calculate the PX credit behind closed doors, and publish the credit ex poste? The PX credit depends on the overall utility portfolio, not just the PX price. Let me know if 10 AM or 3 PM (PST) works better. Harry: I'll assume that you'll contact the folks from EES that need to participate. Best, Jeff

Unless there's an issue, I'll call Fielder first thing this morning. I'm not seeing any upside to us rattling any sabers regarding bankruptcy, however. We'd likely take a very significant reputational and political hit by taking them in---or suggesting that we would take them in, for that matter. Reliant and Mirant have been rattling theirs for a very long time---with no concrete action to back them up. They would of course love to have Enron "lead the charge." I would recommend that we not play that card right now and let Reliant and Mirant go forward if they choose. Best, Jeff -----Original Message----- From: Steffes, James D.

While we have filed a Complaint with the CPUC and are withholding payments, the CPUC may not act until it is too late to recoup our credits (because our contracts with have expired). As you know, there is a view among some at the CPUC that the Negative CTC Credits can only be recovered as a bill offset, and is not a cash obligation. Therefore, SCE restoring the credits to the bills may be the only means to realize our $125 million account receivable. Today Richard Sanders reported that Reliant, Mirant and others were soliciting Enron's participation in an involuntary filing (to be filed possibly as soon as tomorrow). Is there any merit in contacting SCE top management and offering to trade our nonparticipation for restoration of our Negative CTC Credits to our bills? Please call me if you wish to discuss. Thanks.
FYI. Edison has been successful at peeling off one of the ESPs--New West. Seems that in exchange for getting paid negative CTCs, New West may have agreed to take the position that all DA customers should be charged for Edison's undercollection. I'm not aware of any other ESPs that are willing to take that position. The salient quote in New West's "supplemental" PHC statement reads: "It is the position of New West Energy that all customers, both bundled service customers and direct access customers, are equally responsible for payment of the net undercollections. Fairness dictates that bundled customers and direct access customers are both assessed their fair share of the responsibility for repaying the amount of the net undercollections as may be determined by the Commission." Obviously, not a helpful statement. New West's supplemental PHC statement is attached. Best, Jeff

Greetings: First, thanks for the pizza. Second, in line with the "role play" that you described in class and in the handout for the project, we took your direction to heart and tried to make our presentation slides very free of jargon, spreadsheets, reams of numbers, etc.. Given the end-of-semester work load, we, like everyone else, are very appreciative that we will only have to turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet for the project. Given the change, if you would like, we would be happy to "beef up" the presentation to include more numbers, jargon and other technical gems, though the spreadsheet lays out most of that information pretty well. Whichever way you prefer is fine by us. Just let me know. Best, Jeff
no. you're fired, but you have to stay.
Greetings. The reference is specific to statements that we made when FERC first issued it's proposed order on Nov. 1 regarding how to fix the mess in California. We said (and FERC was a little cranky about this) that we were pulling 300 MWs of power plants that we'd planned to build in California on the basis of the price cap proposal included in FERC's proposed order. It was in the press. So it was narrowly confined to the power plant proposals. Calpine subsequently announced that it, too, would pull the peaking plants it had planned to developed. I think that they announced the same amount would be pulled---300 MWs. If you need anything else, don't hesitate to call.

Commissioner Curt Herbert was quoted as saying: "California would rather fight this out for the next five to ten years rather than take steps now to solve the problem." He also expects additional companies to join Enron Corp. and Calpine Corp. in pulling out of the state's market, causing blackouts and ongoing high prices next summer. "We've had three hearings already," Herbert added. "Are customers better off? I don't think so." Meanwhile, State senator Debra Bowen, head of the state Senate Energy Committee, told a hearing in Sacramento yesterday that FERC's plan could lead to re-regulation if residents were not protected from market manipulation. Reuters quotes Bowen as saying: "If there's not political accountability between the people that are making the decisions about what California customers pay and the people who are paying those rates, we're likely to have a revolution at the consumer level that leads to re-regulation regardless of what's in a FERC order" (Dow Jones Newswires, Reuters, Nov. 13).
Mark: Did you have wind of Jason's story on Edison calling for an end to AB 1890? His spin on the story was good one---Edison got everything it wanted (out of 1890) and now it wants out of the contract. The story seems worthy of a response, particularly since Jason's the reporter. Even the Chair of FERC recognizes that going backwards is not the answer. Best, Jeff

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The telecommunications sector led the Nasdaq Composite Index down Tuesday, as investors worrying about the earnings season and a slowdown in carrier spending hammered many stocks to new lows. The selloff of telecommunications carriers and equipment makers was widespread, with all of the big-name companies trading negatively. Shares of optical component maker JDS Uniphase Corp. (JDSU) earlier hit a 52-week low, recently trading down 11% to $14.88. Optical systems market leader Nortel Networks Corp. (NT) also hit a 52-week low, recently trading down 7% to $13. The day's biggest loser in the equipment space was optical systems maker Ciena Corp. (CIEN), which hit a new low and was recently trading down 16.5% to $35.50. The bloodshed was so widespread that a host of other equipment companies also hit new lows: Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) recently traded down 11% to $7.88 while Corvis Corp. (CORV) was recently down 14.4% to $5.19. A rash of earnings warnings by software companies like Redback Networks Inc. (RBAK) and fiber optic equipment maker Harmonic Inc. (HLIT) after the bell Monday, coupled with continued funding concerns for start-up phone companies, served as a one-two punch for the sector. Start-up phone company Winstar Communications Inc. (WCII) recently traded down almost 54% to 41 cents, while peers Teligent Inc. (TGNT) dropped 31% to 28 cents and XO Communications Inc. fell 38% to $3.22. Investors have become increasingly nervous that those companies will face bankruptcy, as the capital markets have dried up. Even well-funded carriers weren't exempt from Tuesday's selling pressure. Shares of Qwest Communications International Inc. (Q) barely stayed above its 52-week low of $32.13, recently dropping 6.2% to $33.50, while shares of AT&T Corp. (T) were off 5.1% to $20 and WorldCom Inc. (WCOM) fell 6.4% to $17.50. -By Johnathan Burns, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2020; johnathan.burns@dowjones.com Folder Name: Telecom Technology: Fiber Optics Relevance Score on Scale of 100: 65 To review or revise your folder, visit Dow Jones CustomClips or contact Dow Jones Customer Service by e-mail at custom.news@bis.dowjones.com or by phone at 800-369-7466.

NOT-SO-GOLDEN STATE Looks Like a Recession Economy on the edge Michael J. Boskin Sunday, July 22, 2001 ,2001 San Francisco Chronicle URL: N144927.DTL California, the world's fifth largest economy, the global capital of technology and entertainment, is teetering on the brink of a serious recession. Unemployment is rising, job creation is falling and respected forecasters are painting a bleak future for the state. California is not alone. Nationally, the employment picture is also troubling. Income is flat. Industrial production has been shrinking for nine months. Only the mighty consumer has kept the economy going. The key problem is the slowdown in information technology spending, so important for California. Once the engine of productivity growth, and the source of rising standards of living, the double-digit pace of those spending increases slowed dramatically, beginning in the second half of last year. Since then, Silicon Valley companies have experienced sales declines of 5 to 10 percent, not calamitous drops, but compared to the 40 percent growth they had been used to, an enormous gap. Hence these companies have been cutting back on everything from production to personnel to facilities. The "new economy," it turns out, is not immune to the basic laws of economics. Nationally, the most respected "blue chip" private forecasters believe we will avoid a recession. They see the economy growing just over 1 percent this year and by 2 to 3 percent next year. Having been more optimistic for some years, I became more pessimistic last year, and remain so despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts and the Bush administration's tax refunds. Whether we skirt the technical definition of a recession -- two consecutive quarters of negative growth -- will be a close call. We should see a modest recovery late this year, and a pick-up of steam in 2002. The California economy is in for a rougher time, at least in the short term. And this time -- unlike the early 1990s, when Southern California bore the brunt of the severe downturn in the defense industry -- the Bay Area will be hit much harder. While the region grew much faster than the rest of the state in the '90s, most of the symbols of that growth -- full employment, exploding property values, shrinking commercial vacancy rates -- are already history. Workers who just a short time ago were getting BMWs as a signing bonus are now being laid off. Statewide unemployment -- 5.1 percent last month -- is likely to increase another percentage point or more as layoffs continue in high tech and aerospace. Still -- and here's some good news -- Bay Area unemployment, even in Santa Clara County, which took a major hit in June, is still below the statewide rate. In per capita income, the San Francisco and San Jose metropolitan areas are ranked first and second nationwide, 75 percent above the national average. What of the longer term? California faces serious problems, not the least of which is the energy mess, which has exacerbated the current slowdown. Our recovery will probably lag several quarters behind the rest of the country. But the long-term picture is brighter. Information technologies have brought about permanent productivity improvements and transformed virtually every major industry in the so-called "old economy." Such enhancements will themselves result in renewed information technology spending, if not at the frenetic pace of the late 1990s. The main concern is whether California will degenerate into an even more anti-business climate. We are already viewed by the business community as an overtaxed, over-regulated state. Gov. Gray Davis' rhetoric, and some of his actions, during the energy debacle have only added to the impression. While Davis deserves credit for using the bully pulpit to encourage energy conservation, his demagogic attacks on "outside" energy companies, and the suggestion that California should go it alone, are not only poor policy solutions but suggest a degree of economic illiteracy on his part. His plan to have the state play an expanded role in energy production and transportation will require the expenditure of billions of dollars. Do we believe the state government could make those investment decisions wisely, efficiently and devoid of politics? California would be better off if the governor got out of the energy business. The state will also continue to pay for the financial mishandling of the energy situation. The initial refusal by Davis' appointees on the Public Utilities Commission to allow utilities to enter long-term contracts worsened the shortages and sharpened the price spikes. Then, at the peak of the market frenzy, the governor's office negotiated long term contracts that lock the state into paying unnecessarily high prices. And by keeping prices to consumers unrealistically controlled, he has passed the burden for energy costs on to the taxpayers -- current and future. With all the problems and missteps, however, there is great reason to be optimistic about California's economic future. We are still a beacon of opportunity. We still attract the best and the brightest. We are still the best incubator of new ideas and businesses. However, our current woes should remind us not to take economic growth for granted. With better state policy -- lower tax rates, less regulation, reforms to improve our schools, and a more efficient energy and transportation infrastructure -- California will reemerge as the leader of a strong national economy, providing opportunity, mobility and still higher standards of living.

Thanks, Sue. FYI--this new schedule was discussed a lot last week, and apparently was a big part of the meeting that occured with Davis' people and Angelides last Thursday nite. It was a move to buy time to try and get a comprehensive settlement in place in the legislature (i.e., core/noncore). In addition to buying time to save Direct Access, it also gives Angelides more time to get the bonds lined up, which seems to be an increasingly challenging task---there's growing speculation that the issuance will be much more difficult than Angelides has thus far let on. That said, I need to check around, but there is some chance that the plan/agreement is that the PUC decisions would go out well in advance of August (with effective date being August), which would then provide enough time to let the expedited "appeals process" under (SB37?) run its course in time for the issuance in Sept/Oct. In short, we'll need to remain vigilant energized because there's a chance that the decisions to which Angelides refers in the memo could be up at the Commission sooner rather than later. This is what I was hearing last Friday, but perhaps things have changed and now there's more time. I'll check and report back. Finally, simultaneous with those actions, folks are supposed to be putting the core/noncore agreement into legislative language. I'll report back as soon as I have more information on that.

make sense to do this if sanders can't make it? jeff
Listening to the Edison call w/investors Edison says they will pay everyone at the same time ("big bang" approach) sometime in Q1'02. My concern is that between now and then Dunn, the AG have the time and resources to make a heckuvalot of mischief, which could be detrimental to generators/marketers' claims. Investors are asking what Edison intends for QFs and generators--asking about haircuts in particular--and Edison is side-stepping the questions.
David: Great start. My biggest comment: needs to be shorter (thank the attention span of the press and the political process for that). I talked to Phil. He's got an editor that he works with who can help. I recommend that we have the editor try to boil it down to an "editorial" size piece. Thoughts? Best, Jeff
In particular, would be nice to know how much of the "wealth transfer" went to the likes of LADWP, other CA munis, Calpine, and the federal government (e.g., BPA, Salt River). Finally, how much did the utilities profit from the high prices (i.e., from selling their excess gen into the PX)?

Though there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding whether and when Davis will call back the California legislature to address the Edison MOU, here's the latest information we have. Faced with horrible polling, an unwilling legislature, an uncooperative California PUC, and a wily leader of the state Senate (Burton), Davis is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature. Rumors of a delay come despite Davis' statements that he would call them back next week. We received the information about a likely delay from an Edison SVP who's working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow. It's Edison's view that the earliest Davis would now call the legislature back is end of next week, with early the following week being most likely. At this point, the chance remains that Davis may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off, leaving Edison to follow PG&E into chapter 11. In the meantime, negotiations between Davis' staff, and staff from the Senate and Assembly continue. We'll report back with information as we get it. Best, Jeff

Hi. Hope the ride back to Sacramento went OK last nite. It was nice to see you and catch up. I'm sorry things are so crazy, but in spite of it all, your attitude's pretty good.

I know your life is very complicated and I don't want to make it worse, but if you ever have the time and inclination to go to lunch, dinner, movie, whatever, I'd definitely be up for it.

The criticism signals that the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has grown impatient with the hail of philosophical charges and counter-charges that have followed FERC's April 26 order on the California market and is turning elsewhere than FERC for a solution. Sources also say it may be a signal that there is a majority on his committee that would support some kind of legislative control on the wholesale power market in the West. "I am issuing an admonition to the financial community," Murkowski said at the conclusion of a hearing on the recent FERC order. "If the financial community will come in and say what terms and conditions they will need to bring new generation into the state, we can cut through this chatter." Among other provisions, the FERC order institutes a plan for price controls during Stage 1 and higher power emergencies. Lawmakers at the hearing, especially from California and the West, criticized the action as insufficient to prevent price gouging. FERC Chairman Curt Hebert said the limited nature of the price controls will continue to provide the power industry with incentives to build power plants in California. Murkowski called on financial interests attending the hearing to settle the debate. "Tells us what you will or will not do under a price cap," said Murkowski. Murkowski indicated that the answer to his question should come directly from top figures in the financial community. Murkowski also signaled that Congress may step in and take legislative action on the California crisis. "We have to question the adequacy of the order and introduce legislation to address problems if necessary," Murkowski said. The sentiment was echoed by other members of the Committee. "We cannot allow our government to sit idly by and allow a tragically flawed and easily manipulated power market wreak havoc on our economy," Sen. Maria Cantwell told Hebert. "If you're not going to take action, Congress is going to act." All three FERC commissioners testified at the hearing but it was Chairman Curt Hebert who was on the receiving end of most of the criticism. "FERC has done a wonderful imitation of a potted plant," Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-ND) told Hebert. "Regulation is not a four letter word. The market system sometimes gets out of wack. Commissioner William Massey also criticized FERC's order, and acted as counterpoint to Hebert throughout the hearing. Commissioner Linda Breathitt defended her support of the April 26 order. "One thing is clear, you all don't get along very well," observed Dorgan. "I'm amazed at what's been done," said Murkowski in defending FERC's action over the past several weeks. "It's better than nothing." "I've been disappointed," replied Dorgan. "I hope FERC decides it's a regulatory body and steps up and takes some action." Sen. Feinstein suggested to Hebert that FERC take a closer look at the impact of skyrocketing natural gas prices on the exorbitant increase in electricity prices in California. In response, Hebert announced that FERC was holding a technical conference May 24 on current and projected natural gas pipelines into California. "I agree that this is a natural gas situation and we intend to look into this as well," Hebert said. Source: EnergyWashington.com Date: May 4, 2001 , Inside Washington Publishers
Greetings Severin: No, I'm not writing inquiring about employment as a research analyst (despite Enron's woes, which I'm sure you've been reading about). However, my fiancee, Prentice Sellers, who got her MBA from Haas last May, is actively looking for work at an interesting place. I wanted to let you know that she has applied for a position at the consulting firm that you're affiliated with. Forgive the less-than-objective plug, but she's extremely bright and talented and did very well at Haas. Prior to attending Haas, she worked at LECG, where she was highly praised for her work and consistently got rave reviews. She'd be a valuable asset to the firm and is worth giving a serious look. Thanks for reading this paid advertisment. On another note, I thought the Hoover conference was extremely good. You and Sweeney did a great job. What was your impression? I've noticed that it got some decent press. Best, Jeff

Adding to Kristin's update, here's the summary of a meeting that just occur= ed with Assembly leadership staff and industry on the Assembly's latest ver= sion of an "Edison MOU": The Speaker's staffer said that if he had to bet at this time, he would bet= that the Assembly would not convene on Friday. He also said that, if it doesn't happen on Friday, nothing will happen unti= l they get back from recess on the 20th of August. The Assembly will let folks know by tonight or first thing tomorrow whether= they intend to move forward with a vote on Friday or recess. From the most recent proposal released today by the Assembly leadership, it= appears that the centrist Democrats are prevailing. The proposal: Retains Direct Access (though they said that they are continuing to be pres= sured by the Treasurer, who wants DA suspended due to the bond issuance) Places 80% of Edison's past debt with large customers (leaving 20% with sma= ll customers, which business customers or strenuously opposing). Eliminates all references to any purchase, or option to purchase, Edison's = transmission. (They said there simply ain't the votes to buy, or consider b= uying, Edison's transmission in the Assembly) Maintains the Senate provision, which would pay the banks, pay the QFs, but= place with Edison the risk of figuring out how to pay the $1billion owed t= o suppliers. (Even the munis are begining to complain about those provision= s.) Creates a tradeable, renewable portfolio standard (conceptually similar to = the one created in Texas). The new bill is created by 1) amending SB78 and 2) gutting a different bill= passed from the Senate to the Assembly, SB39, and replacing it with the ne= w version of 82XX. The two would go together to create the Assembly's newe= st proposal. If this bill gets voted out of the Assembly, it will likely have a difficul= t time getting the votes necessary to pass in the Senate, since the Senate = has considered and rejected several provisions currently included in the As= sembly version.

Mike: Comments looks good. My only comment is that, in our view, the price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I'm not even sure that the Commission can successfully "regulate" prices in the secondary market.) Will the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them? Very unlikely. But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause. I think that it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on record against them. That said, I don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the cap based on our comments. Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on. Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill-advised?

Likely makes sense for Eric to coordinate with Sandi to make the contact with Alpert's office.

Erik could you copy your vitals (title, contact info) to Scott and Hedy Govenar and Sandi McCubbin so they can forward along to Alpert? Erik, seems that it would be useful if the customer letters to Alpert could make the following points (folks please weigh in and add/subtract/modify if needed): The customer's glad to have had the option to take Direct Access service from Enron because having the opportunity to take advantage of the offer has made the customer better off. Direct Access is an extremely important option that customers need, want and should have going forward. Any "solution" that the Legislature comes up with must therefore include the continuation of Direct Access for all customers. As such, the Legislature should immediately fix AB 1X to make sure that Direct Access remains a permanent fixture of California's energy strategy. Direct Access customers should not be forced to pay for DWR's power purchase costs, since Direct Access customers aren't benefitting from those purchases.

The two university systems are asking a federal judge to block the Houston-based energy broker from abandoning four-year contracts. Those contracts guaranteed the universities a reliable supply of power at prices 5 percent below the capped rate created under the state's 1996 deregulation law. The schools say Enron Energy Systems Inc., which promised them protection from the uncertainties of California's deregulation, is now trying to force them to rely on Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison -- the two utilities nearly bankrupted by skyrocketing electricity prices. Enron says the universities will still be guaranteed the price provided in the contracts until the deals run out in March 2002. But at least some of the electricity will now have to be purchased for the campuses by the state Department of Water Resources on the expensive spot market. Prices on the short-term market can be many times greater than prices in long-term deals like those between Enron and the universities. The state or utilities, which cannot charge customers the full cost of electricity because of the rate cap, would be liable for the difference between the current utility rate and the spot market cost. The state, which stepped in as buyer of power in January after the debt-ridden utilities defaulted on payments to power plants, has already spent $3.2 billion buying electricity for utility customers. If Enron gets out of its contracts with UC and CSU, the state also would have to buy as much as 450 megawatts for the two universities. That's enough to power 450,000 homes. In a civil complaint filed Friday in federal court in Oakland, the universities contend that Enron wants to be free to take advantage of soaring market prices for electricity by reselling low-cost power it controls under contracts originally meant to serve the college campuses. "Enron is seeking to capitalize on the energy crisis to reap enormous profits," the civil suit alleges. Enron spokeswoman Peggy Mahoney denied the accusation. "We do not have any power purchased in blocks," Mahoney said. "It is fundamentally not true." Nettie Hoge, executive director of the Utility Reform Network in San Francisco, called the move by Enron "outrageous." "These people have been gouging us and making profits," she said. "If they are making less on some long-term contracts, they should stay with it." Marty Sunde, vice chairman of Enron Energy Services, said he was "shocked" by the lawsuit and believes it is driven by fear of the unknown. "We absolutely, positively are honoring our contract," Sunde said. "(The universities) have a 5 percent discount off the frozen tariff rate." Mahoney said Enron will continue to honor other terms of the contracts by providing billing and advice on how the colleges can minimize their energy use. But Eric Behrens, an attorney for UC, said Enron cannot fulfill those parts of the contracts because it has asked the utilities to rip out thousands of meters that provided information to the company about electricity use on the campuses. The utilities are installing their own meters at the schools. Behrens said UC, one of the largest single users of electricity in the state, went through a laborious process to shift onto Enron's system, spending $1,500 for each of the 2,000 new meters. Even if Enron honors the low rate until the contracts expire, Behrens said, its abrogation of the deals could expose UC and CSU to extra costs of as much as $297 million in coming years by forcing them to become utility customers again. Those customers will probably have to cover a major share of the billions in debt that the utilities and the state have racked up over the past year as wholesale prices for power went through the roof. Until Feb. 1, when Enron took steps to drop them, the universities were so-called direct access customers of Enron. Direct access, a key piece of the state's deregulation plan, was originally intended to lower prices for consumers by allowing companies to compete with the utilities. But the state Legislature, concerned that too many customers were fleeing the utilities, recently passed a bill that could suspend any new contracts under the direct access program. Mahoney said Enron is being forced to release all its direct access customers because the debt-laden utilities have stopped paying Enron and other providers a required rebate. Other residential and institutional customers also are being returned to the utilities. Enron, for example, is returning the San Francisco Giants to PG&E even though the energy company signed a contract to provide electricity to Pacific Bell Park through 2010.

We would like to move to establish this new committee as soon as possible and meet to discuss direction, specific upcoming issues, an overall plan, budget and structure for the year. We would like to start this process with a conference call on Monday March 5, 2001 at 3:00 p.m. Please see call in information below. (It is not necessary for any consultants to participate in the Monday call.) This conference call will be followed by an in-person meeting here at IEP on Thursday March 8, 2001 at 2:00 p.m. If you are interested in participating on this committee please signify that with an e-mail response to this message. For those planning on participating on the conference call we will send out the agenda on Monday. During that conference call we will also set the agenda for the Thursday in person meeting. During the Thursday meeting we would also like to move to select a permanent chairperson. Thank you for your attention to this important matter and I look forward to continuing to work with each of you and make this new committee structure a success. I have set up a permanent Conference Call in number and Pass-code for the Public Affairs Committee that we will use every time we have a conference call. We will begin using this call-in number on Monday. The call in number for Monday's 3:00 p.m. call is is: 1-800-486-2460 The Pass-code is: 120895 Thanks, Katie Kaplan Manager of State Policy Affairs Independent Energy Producers Association (916) 448-9499
Poll thus far: Aron Thomas (AES) just decided not to file. He made the decision after talking to Edison, who told him that Edison is going to suggest in its filing that the surcharge be applied--get this--to the PX credit; thus, ESPs would pay, but then get it back through the credit (can you say "poor quality receivables"?). Aron feels that the issue should be figured out in work shops and the Commission should not decide it in the policy phase. Bill Booth (CLECA) is going to remain silent on the issue because he doesn't know what the position of his members is. Keith McCrae (CMA) is going to say that 1) the surcharge should not apply to direct acces customers and 2) the governor stated publicly that he supports direct access. Jeanne's checking with the Industrial Users Group to see what they're going to say. Since CMA is going to ask for clarification, I would suggest that we remain silent and focus on the other rate design/cost allocation issues, e.g., equity, no cross subsidies. Thoughts? I let you know what I hear back from Jeanne. Best, Jeff

Please treat with discretion. Contact Robert Johnston (x39934) or Kristin Walsh (x39510) for questions or additional info. Bankruptcy Early this week, there was a closed door meeting held by the Western Power Trading Forum in Arizona. The meeting took place outside California to avoid press coverage and allow IPPs to maintain a low profile. Association representatives believe that regardless of what happens with the PUC vs. Utilities ruling expected on Monday, some IPPs will take the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy. Our source expects that absent a significant last minute breakthrough, the filing will happen within the next two weeks, and "probably" next week. As stated in yesterdays report, the IPPs are very low on cash and are not able to cover the debts of the PG&E and Socal. Only three creditors are needed with uncollected debts of more than $10,000 to file involuntary bankruptcy. Bail Out Davis has been meeting with the chief executives of both utilities in a last ditch effort to make a deal prior to Monday's court ruling. The most likely scenario is for state ownership of the utilities transmissions assets. However, coming to an agreed upon price will be very challenging. In addition, PG&E and Edison appear to have competing agendas in pursuing a bail out plan. Davis is expect to continue meetings through out the weekend in hopes of reaching an agreement before Monday.
need to make sure that bev cuts off talks with dunn on this stuff. jeff

Should be of interest. Best, Jeff ----- Forwarded by Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron on 03/12/2001 10:04 AM ----- DISCRETIONARY LOAD CURTAILMENT PROGRAM The California Independent System Operator (ISO) has created the=20 Discretionary Load Curtailment Program (DLCP) to provide additional resourc= es=20 to the grid for the management of potential system emergency conditions. = =20 This program provides an energy-only payment and gives Loads total control= =20 over their curtailments, the control that many need to feel comfortable=20 participating in a demand response program. =20 The DLCP consists of two parts:=20 ? a Day Ahead Request, and=20 ? a Day Of Request for curtailment. =20 The ISO will pay Load Aggregators $500/MWh for Demand they offer and curtai= l=20 in the Day Ahead portion, and $750/MWh for Demand they offer and curtail on= =20 the Day Of portion. =20 This program will act as an umbrella for certain UDCs=01, programs under=20 Assembly Bill AB31x and also attracts any other aggregator that can bid loa= d=20 curtailments into the program. A Load Aggregator (LA) can be any company w= ho=20 enters into a DLCP Agreement with the ISO. Because AB31x provides payments= =20 for the bundled customers that are aggregated by the UDCs, an alternate=20 agreement will be made with them regarding procedures of operation. Non-UD= C=20 Load Aggregators will receive the performance payments from the ISO through= =20 their elected Scheduling Coordinator. =20 The DLCP will operate year-round during the hours of 7:00AM until 8:00PM fr= om=20 now until December 31, 2001. The need for this program will be evaluated= =20 throughout 2001 and implemented for 2002 if needed. Some provisions includi= ng=20 trigger mechanisms and payments may be re-evaluated and changed based on=20 Summer 2001 experience. =20 The ISO is accepting proposals from those interested in being a Load=20 Aggregator, starting on March XX, 2001 and continuing until the end of this= =20 program. For more information and a copy of the Request for Proposals, plea= se=20 visit our web site (this will be posted aft= er=20 the DLCP is approved). The DLCP is intended to provide the ISO with Demand curtailment from Loads= =20 that may not be able to participate in the ISO=01,s Participating Load Prog= ram=20 (Ancillary Services and Supplemental Energy) or the ISO=01,s Summer 2001 De= mand=20 Relief Program. However, contracted DRP Loads may participate in the DLCP= =20 during months outside of the DRP period. Additionally, existing UDC=20 interruptible customers that have met their yearly contractual obligation m= ay=20 participate.

DLCP Request 1. DLCP Day Ahead Request: The ISO will project the need for demand response. The ISO may call on this= =20 program based upon the best temperature, load, and resource forecast=20 information available by 4:00PM the day ahead. The ISO will issue a DLCP D= ay=20 Ahead Request by e-mail to all contracted Load Aggregators.

By 6:00PM on the Day Ahead, the Load Aggregators will submit to the ISO,= =20 through the ISO DLCP website, their committed amounts of Load Curtailment. = =20 The ISO expects that the Load Aggregators will have contacted the End-Use= =20 Loads in their program to determine how much curtailment will be available= =20 and for which hours of the day.=20 2. By 9:00AM of the Day Of, the Load Aggregators will submit their committe= d=20 amounts of curtailment. =20 ? DLCP Confirmation Once the ISO reviews submitted DLCP Offers, ISO Operations will issue an=20 e-mail notice to both the Load Aggregators and their Scheduling Coordinator= s=20 accepting specific DLCP Offers. The ISO will issue the DLCP Confirmation= =20 notice by 7:00PM on the day the Day Ahead Request was made and by 9:30AM fo= r=20 the Day Of Requests. These confirmation notices will request that the Load= =20 Aggregators communicate to the End-Use Loads the required curtailment amoun= t=20 and duration. This will be the only communication (dispatch) to the Load= =20 Aggregators detailing the curtailment. =20 ? DLCP Performance The effectiveness of the DLCP will be based on the performance of each=20 End-Use Load in curtailing their confirmed curtailment amount. The ISO=20 expects that the committed curtailment will occur based on the hours as=20 confirmed through the DLCP Confirmation notices. An aggregator has the=20 responsibility to produce the demand reduction it confirms. There is no se= t=20 penalty, except that continued poor performance could result in revocation = of=20 the DLCP Agreement. =20 ? Performance Measurement Guidelines The measurement of performance for each End-Use Load will be performed by t= he=20 Load Aggregators. Each Load Aggregator will have an ISO approved performan= ce=20 measurement plan, which will be used to calculate the DLCP performance. Th= e=20 performance measurement plan shall include the following: ? For interval metered End-Use Loads the Load Aggregator will calculate a= =20 baseline Load profile. DLCP performance will be measured by the difference= =20 between baseline Load profile and the meter read for the hour(s) of=20 curtailment. =20 ? For non-interval metered Loads, DLCP performance will be calculated by=20 using a combination of sample measurements, historic data, process controls= ,=20 use of data loggers, and any other performance measurement method approved = by=20 the ISO. Load Aggregators shall obtained ISO approval prior to offering DL= CP=20 for non-interval metered End-Use Loads. (It should be noted that the ISO= =20 favors interval meters.) ? DLCP Settlement Each DLCP Offer for which a DLCP Confirmation was issued by the ISO shall b= e=20 uniquely identified. Therefore, DLCP Day Ahead and DLCP Day Of offers must= =20 be separately identified. The Load Aggregators (except for the UDCs) shall= =20 submit the DLCP Performance Measurement for each confirmed offer by using t= he=20 DLCP website no later than 45 days following the operating day of the DLCP= =20 Curtailment. The ISO will calculate the performance payment by simply=20 multiplying the DLCP energy price ($500/MWh for DLCP Day Ahead and $750/MWh= =20 for DLCP Day Of) by the amount of DLCP (in MWs) for each hour of confirmed= =20 curtailment. For each month the performance payments will be summed up for= =20 all the confirmed curtailments and paid to the Load Aggregator=01,s nominat= ed=20 Scheduling Coordinator. The payment will be made to the Scheduling=20 Coordinator in accordance to the ISO Payment Calendar timeline. =20 The ISO recognizes that UDCs acting as Load Aggregators will have specific= =20 rules to follow for the settlement of the dispatched curtailment. The UDCs= =20 will be responsible for following the settlement rules and regulations set= =20 forth by the CPUC for the End-Use Loads. =20 How to enroll in the DLCP: Load Aggregator 1.

Harry: At the meeting yesterday, we concluded that it would be a good idea to take the proposal that you put together based on your meeting with EES and use it as the "base case" to start running the numbers. Idea being that before we shop anything around, we need to know what the numbers look like to determine whether the thing's got any legs. Once we have a clear understanding of how the base case numbers shake out, we thought we might then want do some sensitivity analyses around the variables, come up with a final proposal, and then go back to the commercial groups for buy-in. We hoped that your folks could get together with Roger Yang et al and provide some assessment of what the base case numbers look like by middle of next week. How's this plan sound? Few other points: We assume that bullet 6's reference to "net" means that the deferral is calculated by taking any "overcollections" and subtracting them from any "undercollections" over the entire 3 year period,not year-by-year. What is the significance of the 3.1 CTC roll-off date? We're assuming it's commercially driven. We correct? If so, what's the driver? Same goes for the 2004 ending date. Some tweeks were made to the proposal at the meeting to create an "Option 2" for folks to consider. (Though we don't think that any numbers need to be run on "Option 2" until after having completed the analysis on option 1, since those results could influence any scenarios we decide to construct). Option 2 would: Keep the hydro with the utility and apply Edison's proposed ratemaking treatment. Beginning 6.1.01, make large customers "noncore," similar to the gas model in California, and force those customers to choose an ESP. Beginning 1.1.03, introduce competitive default service for remaining "core" (i.e., rez and small commercial) customers. Finally, couple of things that occurred to me after yesterday's meeting that I want to throw out for folks to react to: Seems that, to be successful, the proposal needs to remain as stripped down and simple as possible. When the proposal nets out the deferral costs, does it include the over/undercollections associated with utility residual generation? In option 2, by adding the "noncore" feature, and by implementing that feature and the default service feature prior to the 04 ending date, the proposal gets more complicated (and adds significantly more risk to the utility's position). This is not to say that the complications can't be worked out, or that the added risk can't be accounted for, but wanted to highlight it for folks to consider. Attached is the original, with just a couple of minor edits, and "Option 2." Best, Jeff
FYI: I'm scheduled to meet with CMA and the Chamber on Monday to discuss the comprehensive solution and urge them to support it. Best, Jeff

Best, Jeff Consumer Groups, Calif PUC Question Pwr Contract Validity LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Two California consumer groups have asked California Attorney General Bill Lockyer to investigate whether some state electricity contracts should be nullified because of a possible conflict of interest held by one of the state's negotiations, according to a press release Monday. The Utility Reform Network and Consumers Union asked Lockyer to examine whether income earned from energy companies by consultant Vikram Budhraja presented a conflict of interest, because he may have been involved in contract negotiations with those companies We believe there is ample evidence for the Attorney General to investigate whether some of the state's electricity contracts were made in violation of California's conflict of interest laws," said Bill Ahern, senior policy analyst with Consumers Union West Coast Regional Office. "If the Attorney General finds that a contract was made in violation of the law, it must be set aside as void." Three weeks after Budhraja's January hire date, Williams Companies (WMB news msgs won a $3.4 billion contract to provide power to the state over 10 1/2 years. Budhraja disclosed in mid-August that his company, the Electric Power Group, was paid more than $10,000 by Williams during the previous 12 months. Budhraja was hired by the California Department of Water Resources to negotiate power contracts, but hasn't said which generators he dealt with in the weeks before the Williams contract was signed. "It is reasonable to assume that Budhraja may have been involved in the negotiations that led to the Williams contract," Ahern said. "It is also likely that there are more detailed records and evidence in existence, which only a subpoena or search warrant may uncover." The groups also are concerned that Budhraja may have held a conflict of interest due to his potential involvement in negotiating a $3.9 billion contract with Allegheny Energy Inc. (AYE news msgs while he owned stocks in energy companies, according to the release. The Attorney General's office recently said it doesn't plan to investigate conflicts of interest involving energy contract negotiations. No one at the office could be reached for comment Monday. The California Public Utilities Commission is also petitioning federal regulators to throw out some of the state's $43 billion in long-term energy contracts, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Monday. The CPUC has argued in filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission over the past three months that energy companies took advantage of the state's energy crisis to negotiate high-priced contracts, according to the report. The average price of power under the contracts is $69 a megawatt-hour, more than double peak electricity prices last week. CPUC lawyers have filed challenges before the FERC on deals negotiated with Scottish Power (SPI news msgs unit PacifiCorp, Alliance Colton LLC, Sempra Energy (SRE news msgs and Calpine Corp. (CPN news msgs according to the report. Budhraja disclosed in August that he owned as much as $10,000 in Scottish Power stock while a $1 billion long-term contract with subsidiary PacifiCorp was being hammered out. The state signed the 10-year contract July 6. Budraha sold his stock July 30. State officials say Budhraja had nothing to do with the deal, according to the report.

The following is a transcription of the governor's comments: Governor Davis: "For the remarks on the long-term bidding contracts, I am going to have Director Hannigan make those comments. I want to thank the work of the bipartisan team standing behind me. We are tied at the hip. We are making progress. We are keeping the lights on. We are assuring people that prices will be affordable and we are making real progress in securing good, well-priced long-term contracts. I am very positively inclined as a result of these bids. It is good news, I am enthusiastic, and it tells us we can stay within our general parameter, which is to provide power within the rate structure consistent with aggressive conservation and aggressive efforts to put more supply on line. This, as you know, is at least a three corner billiards shot, it may be more difficult than that. But so far the signs are positive, I want Director Hannigan to just give you a brief summary of the results of the bidding process and then I will give you a couple more comments and then I will ask the legislative leaders to add their commentary." Director of the Department of Water Resources Tom Hannigan: "Thank you Governor, as the Director of the Department of Water Resources, I am given responsibility for trying to keep the lights on. Our fundamental responsibility here is to purchase power at the best possible prices for California consumers and businesses, and to protect the state's ability to purchase power at the best price. We are only able to release general information about the bid opening today. There were 39 bidders, the majority of them were compliant, the weighted average which included all of the times of the days and nights of the year except for super-peaks was 6.9 cents per kilowatt. The useful sample across all times of the day across the spectrum of the year and we are quite pleased with the initial results. I look forward to looking through bids and developing some long-term contracts." Governor Davis: "I would like to make a further announcement of three people who have been advising me over the last several days, one is Mike Peevey, who is serving as my unpaid special advisor on a whole range of matters. He has had a discussion with the CEOs of the two utilities in question, he has sat in several meetings, he has a long history with the energy business, of which he is no longer a participant in or a shareholder in. His advice and counsel is very much appreciated and I thank him for his assistance thus far and what I know will be future assistance of great consequence. "I also want to announce David Freeman, the General Manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, has agreed to serve on a short-term basis, probably a month to six weeks, as a consultant for the Department of Water Resources. His job, working with Mike Peevey in this instance, is to get the very best possible deal for the ratepayers of California. His job will be to take the most favorable bids that came in today and consummate those into contracts to have unilateral discussions -- assuming we get the authority to do that -- for more good bids and if necessary, to go out and request more bids. "As anybody knows, in the power business you don't try and acquire all your long-term power at once. It's done sequentially over time, that's the methodology that assures the best price and best quantity of power for the rate payer. Mike, I want to make clear, will be advising on a whole range of issues, and in addition to that, he'll be working with David Freeman. David's exclusive responsibilities will be to advise the Department of Water Resources on additional long-term contracting and how to consummate the best bids that were offered today. "Obviously if you have an average weighted price of 6.9 cents per kilowatt hour, that means that there were some bids below that and some bids above that. We hope we will be able to consummate contractual relations with some of the bids that were below the average price, as well as move aggressively forward in the future. "The final name, I am very pleased to say that we have been consulting with is Frank Zarb. Frank is the CEO and chairman of the NASDAQ and he was President Ford's energy czar during the first oil and gas price crisis in the 1970's. He has subsequently been the CEO of Smith Barney, and he has years of experience in the utility business. He was tasked by Governor Pataki last year to be the temporary CEO of the Long Island Power and Energy Authority. He is well-versed in this area, and he will be advising us on a range of matters, including ways in which to keep the utilities viable in the future and keep us appraised of market and financial expectations in that regard. These three people have been advising us in the recent days and will continue to do so. "With that I would like to call upon..." (members speak) Question and Answers: "Thank you, we'll be happy to take a few questions." Question: "Will these bids assure that you'll be able to provide electricity without raising rates?" Governor Davis: "That has been my hope and it continues to be my expectation. This is a very good step. Obviously we have a way to go to finalize the best bids made today and to secure additional power to complete the entire profile necessary. This is a very good step, and all of us are pleased with the preliminary results." Question: "It's not an assurance though, the bids aren't so good that you are sure that you'll be able pull this off without a rate increase." Governor Davis: "No, but that continues to be my hope and expectation. There was nothing about the bidding process that discourages me, everything encourages methat we can live within the framework we've all described. Everyone has mentioned the three component parts -- Native Generation, QF's and what we call the net short. And the first two are well within the rate structure and it's our expectation that we can get the third piece within it as well." Question: "Governor, was there enough power bid in the short term to keep the lights on say to February without going into the spot market?" Governor Davis: "Let me ask Mr. Hannigan. As I said, I want to protect the integrity of the bid process. That's why the only information I asked of the Director is the information he's already described to you, so you're going beyond my pay grade at the moment, I have to call on the Director." Director Hannigan: "Well as I said at the outset, I have not seen the bids and I don't know what the numbers are. It is a sealed bid process and we're respecting the integrity of that. But we have been buying power both on the day ahead market and the real time market, hourly market, real-time market. It's a function of trying to work these generators down, get them to sell us power at the cheapest price we can get from them, and through that we hope to make it through the first of February. I think we're looking a little farther than that." Question: "The Legislature has set aside money to get us through February 2. My question is whether these contracted governments." Director Hannigan: "These contracts really don't relate to the short-term getting through that time frame." Question: "When does the long-term begin?" Director Hannigan: "Well the long-term begins, of course, when the contract date suggests they begin, but we don't know what that will be at this point. It could be in a week, it could be shorter. Some of them it could be longer, it depends on how long it takes to negotiate them with them and what kind of terms you get." Question: "Do you think based on these numbers that you could reach the point described frequently as 5 1/2 cents?" Director Hannigan: "I don't know that. That is the same question as can you reach a point where you don't raise the rate." Question: "That apparently is the point in which you don't raise the rate?" Director Hannigan: "Yeah, so I don't know that Dan." Unknown Speaker: "I don't know that that is correct. Built into that presumption is that you don't get any relief on the QF's which we're now paying between 16 and 19 cents to the extent that you get relief on the QF's then that 5 1/2 cents can raise without a rate increase." Question: "Does that mean that, Hertzberg, you don't need your front-loaded program which leaves the bonds up front to cover the initial cost? You don't need the program at all?" Speaker Hertzberg: "No, I think you do in order to use revenue bonds to pay for the near term. Obviously, yes, the answer is yes, you do need it. It will be smaller." Question: "The near terms are going to need those revenue bonds?" Speaker Hertzberg: "Well yeah, you need them to take out that bump in the near term. But how many bonds you issue depends upon what these prices are. But yeah, you are going to need some facility clearly just as a means to collect the money back from the customers. There still has to be some mechanism in place to do that." Question: "Governor do you agree with having to use revenue bonds up front?" Governor Davis: "I believe it is an appropriate mechanism, we'll have more to say about that in the next couple of days, but we have been in constant contact with all the people behind me as well as Assemblyman Campbell, who we were visiting earlier tonight. And we understand that what we're looking forward to is essentially price stabilization. So in the short-term, price paid by energy customers is going to be less than the actual price of energy. In the long-term, the price of energy will fall but the price will remain constant to the consumers. It is our collective expectation that if we can tell the business and residential consumers of the state that their price will stay relatively stable over a sustained period of time, that they will see that as a good deal. Do you understand what I'm saying? Obviously if you look at the spot market, you can see today's prices considerably higher than the 5 to 5 1/2 percent range that we originally thought was necessary to stay within the current rate structure. Because the negotiations led primarily by Senator Battin and Assemblyman Keeley were so successful in the QF part of the equation, we have a little more flexibility on the long-term contracting although not a lot more flexibility. Question: "Is there enough energy bids to cover the net short positions? Especially this summer?" Governor Davis: "It is my understanding that we had a very representative bid and that's the only information that we've been shared... We had a good deal of power bid for and it was a very good sample and certainly one that gives us all optimism." Question: "What I mean to ask is this 10,000 Kilowatts or Megawatts that possibly the state's looking for? Is it enough to cover that gap?" Governor Davis: "As I said before, it would be a mistake. I'm talking in general terms now. It would be a mistake for the state to try and acquire all its power at once. That would drive up the cost and saddle the taxpayer with higher costs than are necessary. The Department of Water Resources knows that and they are proceeding appropriately." Question: "Governor, just for our viewers very simply, is it reasonable to expect that some of these long-term bidding contracts will start next week? Next month? When do you think?" Governor Davis: "We're hopeful to get authority from the Legislature within a week to begin consummating the better proposals that were received today. Under the guidance and advice from Mike Peevey and David Freeman, we expect the Department of Water Resources to move aggressively to enter into unilateral arrangements with other potential bidders, go back to ones whose bids were initially rejected to see if we can negotiate better prices. We're on this like white on rice, we are determined to get the best prices as soon as we can. But it is a mistake to try and get it all done within a week. We'll end up paying more for it than we have to." Question: "Is there any possibility that you'll run out of cash before you sign the contract?" Governor Davis: "It's my expectation and hope that we will not. We have obviously emergency authorities so we can draw upon but it is my expectation and hope that we can live within the resources allocated to us on a short-term basis and then have the authority to switch over to long-term contracting." ### Katie Kaplan Manager of State Policy Affairs Independent Energy Producers Association (916) 448-9499

Please call and fax PUC=20 Commissioners Brown, Duque and Lynch (info below) SVMG Member Companies: We URGENTLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT in sending a strong message today and tomorrow to the PUC that the proposed rate proposal is unacceptable to SVMG employers, its workers and families. We have only until 6 pm this evening to submit formal comments for the proposed rate structure just this morning. A brief analysis is below. Please call or fax the following Public Utilities Commissioners IMMEDIATELY with our urgent message. Please and let me know if you and your organization have done so. Also, don't forget to avail yourself of one last opportunity to directly meet with the PUC at a public hearing regarding this rate proposal at the Doubletree Hotel tomorrow (Friday May 12, 2001) at 3:00, 2050 Gateway Place. To participate you must arrive early and sign-in to speak. A membe= r of the Public Advisor's Office will be there for assistance.

Justin Bradley Director of Energy Programs 408 501 7852 ********************* Geoffrey Brown - Phone 415 703 1407; Fax 415 703 1294 (Perhaps the key swin= g vote, most important focus of advocacy) Henry M. Duque - Phone 415 703 3700; Fax 415 703 3352; (Historically on sid= e of business but needs encouragement) Carl Wood - Phone 415 703 2440; Fax 415 703 2532 (Most anti-business votin= g record; probably intractable) President Loretta Lynch - 415 703 2444; Fax 415 703 1758 (Unlikely to change vote from public stance but worth a try based on past relationships and connection to Gov. Davis) ************** The PUC unveiled their proposal with the following rate allocations: Residential customers are protected with an average rate increase of 17%, Small commercial users 45% Large energy users up to from 50 to 75%. This does not include the 1 cent rate increase proposed in January which would increase the large energy users rate by 100%. A fair and proportiona= l rate increase would be an average increase of 34% for all customers. President Lynch admitted that this may not be enough, and that additional rate increases could be required in the future. In protecting the residential rate classes, the PUC is shifting approximately $1 Billion from the residential rates to all other customer classes. It is important that we all SVMG member companies communicate to our PUC Commissioners the danger of protecting residential rates where the use of power is more discretionary and flexible than for employers. Unfairly high business rates decrease productive electricity use with subsequent loss of goods and services and JOBS. Protecting the residential rate class is bad policy because it guts the incentive for many residents to conserve. SVMG understands that prices must rise significantly to accommodate the cos= t of electricity. It is regrettable. But any plan must be equitable and proportional between all rate classes with no cross subsidization. The SVMG press release form this morning is below. The PUC release is in the link below. The PUC release. *************** P.U.C. IS A.W.O.L. ON PROPOSED RATE INCREASE=01,S EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY AND EFFORTS FOR RESIDENTIAL CONSERVATION For Immediate Release: Contact: Michelle Montague-Bruno May 10, 2001 (408) 501-7853 =01&The disproportional rate increases proposed by the PUC will devastate t= he state and potentially the nation=01,s economy,=018 said Carl Guardino, pres= ident and CEO of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, in response to electricity rate increases being suggested by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) and its President Loretta Lynch. The PUC president=01,s proposal has three critical flaws: 1. It undermines the Governor and the Legislature=01,s conservation plan;= which already tilts heavily toward residential customers, because the PUC proposa= l provides individuals with no incentives to conserve. 2. It is devastating to California=01,s economy; which will cripple Calif= ornia companies and every working family that depends on a healthy business climate to maintain jobs. 3. Coupled with the economic downturn California employers already face, this Commission is either insensitive or ignorant to the further loss of jobs this proposal could create. =01&The PUC may think that by shielding residential customers from paying o= ur proportionate share that they are doing everyone a favor; yet it=01,s prett= y hard to pay your bills when a disproportionate plan forces your employer ou= t of business or out of California,=018 said Guardino. Yesterday, the PUC proposed raising rates for some employers by 50 to 75 percent, which would be the second increase handed to the industrial business community this year. For many employers, the recently proposed rate increases will equate to a 100 percent increase in electric bills in less than five months. =01&This is irresponsible behavior at a time when the state=01,s economy is already reeling from an economic downturn that has hurt employers and lost jobs for working families,=018 said Guardino. =01&Many companies, including Roche Pharmaceuticals, have had very aggressi= ve energy reduction programs in place for several years, which will continue. To further cut consumption - in order to pay for a non-proportional and destructive rate increase -- for some employers, could mean cutting into their workforce, or leaving the area all together,=018 said Dr. James Woody= , President of Roche Pharmaceuticals R&D in Palo Alto and Chairman of the Board of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group. =01&We want to do our fai= r share in paying for rate increases, but the disproportionate nature of this proposal could be devastating to employers. We need a rate structure that will allow employers to thrive and help pull us out of this economic downturn.=018 The Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group understands and acknowledges the nee= d to raise electric rates to help minimize blackouts, which will protect the public=01,s health and safety. However, to achieve desired conservation an= d fairness, it is essential that all Californians share proportionally in rat= e adjustments. =01&Proportional rate increases should be implemented with no rate shifting between classes of energy users. Member companies of SVMG are committed to being part of the solution, as we work together to conserve power, retain our workforce and ensure a healthy economy,=018 said Guardino. =01&Apparently, the PUC is out of touch with working families, conservation= or jobs in California,=018 said Guardino. =01&It=01,s a naive proposal. It a= ssumes we can put a firewall between working families and jobs their employers provide; but instead this notion threatens the livelihoods of California workers and businesses.=018

California Lawmakers Vote to Limit Power Costs By Rebecca Smith 09/01/2000 The Wall Street Journal Page A4 (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) California lawmakers voted to extend modest relief to San Diego residents burdened with high electricity bills and set the groundwork for faster construction of badly needed power plants. They stopped short, however, of passing legislation that would roll back retail power rates to levels seen prior to deregulation . Late Wednesday, lawmakers sent a bill to Gov. Gray Davis that limits to 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour the amount that small customers of San Diego Gas & Electric Co. can be charged. The utility is allowed to add power-delivery and other reasonable costs to that commodity price. The price, equivalent to a bulk power cost of $65 per megawatt hour, is far higher than the average price of power for 27 of the 31 months in which California's market has been deregulated. But in June and July, the average price of power obtained by the utility from a state-sanctioned energy auction rose to 12 cents and 10.5 cents, respectively, compared with the 2.3 cents and 2.8 cents charged in those months a year earlier. Passed directly through to customers,the resulting bills sparked a near mutiny. The rate-cap measure applies to residential and small commercial customers, as well as to schools and hospitals. In addition to the rate cap, which can be adjusted upward or downward by the California Public Utilities Commission until December 2002, the legislature earmarked $150 million of general-fund revenue, which can be used to subsidize San Diego power costs if they greatly exceed the 6.5-cents-per-kilowatt-hour rate. For now, the utility would be expected to make up any difference between revenue collected and the actual cost. Steve Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, parent of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., said the rate-cap measure is "deeply flawed" because it limits the amount prices can rise but sets no floor. That means any shortfall could grow -- without a mechanism for customers to pay it down -- until the end of the rate-cap period, which could last until December 2002 or December 2003. Mr. Baum said Sempra stands to suffer an undercollection of perhaps $664 million, provided future prices approximate the New York Mercantile Exchange forward prices through December 2002. "It's irreparably damaging to Sempra," he said because it "creates tremendous uncertainty" that makes it hard for the San Diego energy company to finance new projects such as a new transmission line. The legislature also appeared likely to approve a bill speeding up the permit process for the construction of new power plants, in part by beefing up staffs of regulatory agencies that review the plans.

Barry, et al: FYI. Some initial info I got from our outside council regarding utility authority to engage in financial risk management tools. More info to follow as we get it. If you have quesitons, comments, or suggestions for additional research needed, just holler. Please forward to others who might need it. Best, Jeff ++ Electric: SCE, PG&E and SDG&E are all authorized to enter into bilateral forward transactions with non-ISO or PX parties. D.00-08-023 and D.00-09-075. These transactions are limited to contracts which must expire on or before 12-31-05. Initial contracts are subject to a blanket reasonableness test (if less than 5% above cost of non-forward cost of portfolio=deemed reasonable) but contracts after 12-31-02 will be subject to a CPUC preapproval process. Gas: PG&E authorized to use gas hedges for all purposes (D.98-12-082) but limited to contracts expiring on or beforce 12-31-02 and limited to $200 million in cost or 800 MMcfd in volume. We are looking for a similar resolution or decision for Sempra. Haven't found it yet, but we believe they have been given similar authority.

And what about those 9-ers? -----Original Message----- From: Nancy Sellers Sent: Monday, October 08, 2001 4:15 PM To: Dasovich, Jeff Subject: RE: So did I!! Thank you for the check - I appreciate it. I was actually kind of hoping you wouldn't want it! It is such great wine and I did not expect her to give me the 50% off or I would have bought more! When would you be around to pick up your other wine? I don't want to order it and have it sitting in our clean garage! Also the check you sent for golf was too much because you guys walked and did not take a cart. You should have paid $80 - so you have an $80 credit toward wine.

Thanks. I'll take 12 magnums. And please order 2 cases of Coastal zin. I think that we'll likely come by either before or after the dome trip this weekend. I can pay you then. I'm not looking to make money on the grapes. Just looking for someone to finance the development of my land. And I'd have a vineyard to look at all the time! That'd be enough for me.

Edison Utility Rescue-Plan Session Set for Oct. 9 by Davis By Michael B. Marois Sacramento, California, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A special legislative session to consider a rescue package for Edison International's insolvent California utility won't begin until Oct 9., aides for Governor Gray Davis said. The governor had been expected to call lawmakers back Oct. 2. His aides didn't explain the reasons for the delay. The governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p.m. San Francisco time, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said. Southern California Edison, California's second-largest utility, accrued $3.9 billion in debt under the state's deregulation law, which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise. Some of the utility's creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy. PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy in April. The Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package, prompting Davis to announce he would call lawmakers back to Sacramento to consider a new plan. The latest Edison measure may let the utility sell $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt, secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers, Davis aides said last week.
We're on at 9:30 AM California time. I'll call you early in the AM to confirm, coordinate, ruminate, etc. Best, Jeff

FYI. ----- Forwarded by Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron on 05/14/2001 08:47 PM ----- Jeff Dasovich Sent by: Jeff Dasovich 05/14/2001 08:47 PM To: sryan@aesc.com, hoffman@blackstone.com, bbailey@duke-energy.com, Lynn.A.Lednicky@Dynegy.com, john.harrison@elpaso.com, rachael.king@elpaso.com, clark.smith@elpaso.com, skean@enron.com, tom.allen@mirant.com, sonnet.edmonds@mirant.com, randy.harrison@mirant.com, alex.goldberg@williams.com cc: Maureen McVicker/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: Summary of Today's Call/Agenda for Tomorrow's Call Greetings: In order to keep everyone in the loop, the folks on today's call wanted to send out a brief summary of the call for the benefit of those who couldn't make it. Apologies for any omissions, inaccuracies, etc. Others who were on the call please chime in if I've gotten anything wrong, or missed anything. Best, Jeff SUMMARY Enron, Duke, El Paso and Williams were on the call, as was Michael Hoffman of the Blackstone Group (the Governor's financial advisors). On the subject of how the group would organize itself, it was agreed that the calls would be open to anyone who wanted to participate. A smaller group consisting of Duke, El Paso, Enron, and Williams would take the lead on walking the halls of Sacramento, meeting with policy makers, and advocating whatever plan the group develops. Folks agreed that achieving a comprehesive solution requires a tangible process; that is, the principals need to get in a room, face to face, for however long it takes to work out a resolution. It was agreed that the process should start no later than the beginning of next week, and that it should take place in Sacramento. It was decided that the Legislature and the Attorney General needed to be brought into the process as soon as possible, i.e., next week. There was some discussion regarding the release today of "Plan B." Plan B is a plan proposed by Democratic and Republican legislators as an alternative to the MOU that the Governor struck with Edison. After that call I received a copy of "Plan B." If you'd like a copy please send me your fax number. Folks on the call agreed to have the next "supplier-only" call-in meeting on Friday. Finally, Michael Hoffman said that they are hoping to have a "ratings agency level" presentation prepared by the end of the week. The goal of the presentation is to reassure capital markets that the bonds the state seeks to issue are solidly backed by retail rates. The Agenda for Tomorrow's Call with the Governor's Staff Item #1: The Credit Issue Michael Hoffman said that the Governor's office wants to start tomorrow's meeting discussing the creditworthiness issue. Hoffman said that the Governor's folks are hoping to have completed by the start of tomorrow's meeting a draft of an agreement between the California PUC and CDWR. The agreement is designed to ensure that DWR gets paid for power services delivered. If the draft is ready, they'd like to discuss on the call tomorrow. Item #2: Identify the Components of a Comprehensive Solution. It was agreed that our group should put on the table at tomorrow's meeting the universe of issues that need to be included in a comprehensive solution. Enron was asked to take a first stab at what those components are. The following is a brief outline, which is not intended to be definitive, but a starting point for discussion. Utility creditworthiness retail rates must reflect costs Increase supply streamline and otherwise reform the siting process Decrease demand establish real-time pricing implement demand buy-down and other conservation programs Create a real market Remove the State from the power-buying business as soon as possible (e.g., once new rates are in place and utilities are returned to creditworthiness; approximately 3-6 months) Return the procurement role to the utilities Reinstate Direct Access immediately for all customers Within 18-24 months, create a "core/noncore" market structure for electricity, similar to California's market structure for natural gas Keep the industry in the hands of the private sector Reject proposals calling on the State to take over transmission, generation, etc. Resolve outstanding legal claims, investigations, etc. Resolution requires certainty and prompt payment (understanding that discounts on receivables is on the table for discussion)
Hey. Work prevented me from going to class at all last nite. Does the course seem like it will be good? Were there a million people there? Chances are very low that I'll get in, but I'm gonna try anyway. I'm on vacation next week (yeah), but maybe we can catch during the break on the following Tuesday or Wednesday. Good to see you the other night. Take care. Best, Jeff -----Original Message----- From: Courtney Abernathy Sent: Tuesday, July 24, 2001 12:51 AM To: Jeff Dasovich Subject: Stranger Hey there!

Few things: Linda: Thanks very much for the call and the help.Tyson is calling John Doer (sp?) to try to get him in the loop. And she agreed to send the proposal to Summers today. Proposal to follow. I'm working with a guy named Phil Verleger (MIT economist type who worked in Ford and Carter), who I met at the meeting on Saturday, to come up with a list of individuals with Democratic, contributor, business community credientials that can be contacted to seek support for the proposal. Any suggested contacts that folks have would be helpful. John Nesslage (who works for Jim) is running some numbers to get an idea of the size of rate increases required to pay back the loans under a 10-year term structure The UC Berkeley econ/biz school faculty members I met with on Saturday want to issue a press release stating there view on "what not to do" (i.e., don't have the state take over anything, period). They want to give us a copy to review for comments/edits before they issue it. I should be getting tonite or first thing in the AM tomorrow. May not go anywhere, but I told them that I'd be happy to review it. Jeff
My consultant buddy, Tom Beach is the technical consultant for Jerry Bloom's organization, the California Cogeneration Coalition (or something like that). About 1000 MW of cogen throughout the state. I've tentatively set up a meeting with him for Wednesday at 11 AM. So we can do Alcantar at 9, and Tom at 11. That work? Best, Jeff
